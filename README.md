## NOTES AND STEPS TO BUILDING THE REVENTS WEB APP
The codebase for each step can be found in the commit link


## PROJECT SETUP

### [1. Create project using create-react-app](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/e9baf38b60a5844a15ce5cf2e56945fa608ca0b4)
- Run in command line. The --use-npm flag is to ensure that we're using the npm package manager: `npx create-react-app react-revents --use-npm`
- Once the React app has been successfully created, cd into the directory: `cd react-revents`
- Then run: `npm start`
- Can view the react-revents app in the browser: `http://localhost:3000`

### [2. Hot Module Replacement](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/b013c8cb6fa42f1efca0e7e5b7e64267da947968)
- The hot module replacement prevents a full page reload when we make changes to our code
- In index.js file:
  ```javascript
  const rootEl = document.getElementById('root');

  function render() {
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootEl);
  }

  if (module.hot) {
    module.hot.accept('./App', function () {
      setTimeout(render);
    });
  }

  render();
  ```

### [3. Semantic UI React](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/055a9875971668db010e0eb91f0a4b22bb49f3bc)
- Website: www.react.semantic-ui.com
- Semantic UI React and Semantic UI CSS
  - Run to install both: `npm i semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css`
- In index.js file:
  - Import the semantic min css just above the styles.css file: `import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css';`


## EVENT DASHBOARD PAGE LAYOUTS

### [1. Create EventDashboard component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/c69298f4ed967e9fd7de90f1326208235cc44b05)
- This component renders two columns, a 10-column grid and a 6-column grid, using Semantic Grid component
- In src/features/events/eventDashboard folder, create a component/file called EventDashboard.jsx
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import semantic Grid component: `import { Grid } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write an EventDashboard functional component
    - Render the Semantic UI Grid in JSX for now
    - Semantic UI uses a 16-column grid system
  ```javascript
  export default function EventDashboard() {
    return (
      <Grid>
        <Grid.Column width={10}>
          <h2>Left Column</h2>
        </Grid.Column>
        <Grid.Column width={6}>
          <h2>Right Column</h2>
        </Grid.Column>
      </Grid>
    );
  }
  ```
- In src/app/layout folder, create a component/file called App.jsx
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import the EventDashboard component: `import EventDashboard from '../../features/events/eventDashboard/EventDashboard';`
  - Write an App functional component that renders other components to the page
  - Render the EventDashboard component inside JSX
  ```javascript
  export default function App() {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Re-vents</h1>
        <EventDashboard />
      </>
    );
  }
  ```

### [2. Add NavBar component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/36c81d794452febedec81e88441b457b25f4ef77)
- Create Navigation menu
- In features/nav folder, create a component/file called NavBar.jsx
- In NavBar.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic Button, Container, and Menu: `import { Button, Container, Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write a NavBar functional component that renders the navigation menu using Semantic UI components
  ```javascript
  export default function NavBar() {
    return (
      <Menu inverted fixed='top'>
        <Container>
          <Menu.Item header>
            <img src='/assets/logo.png' alt='logo' style={{ marginRight: 15 }} />
            Revents
          </Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item name='Events' />
          <Menu.Item>
            <Button positive inverted content='Create Event' />
          </Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item position='right'>
            <Button basic inverted content='Login' />
            <Button
              basic
              inverted
              content='Register'
              style={{ marginLeft: '0.5em' }}
            />
          </Menu.Item>
        </Container>
      </Menu>
    );
  }
  ```
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import the NavBar component: `import NavBar from '../../features/nav/NavBar';`
  - Import Semantic Container: `import { Container } from 'semantic-ui-react';` 
  - Render the NavBar component just above the EventDashboard component. Also wrap the EventDashboard component in a container so we can apply styles to it
  ```javascript
  export default function App() {
    return (
      <>
        <NavBar />
        <Container className='main'>
          <EventDashboard />
        </Container>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
- In src/app/layout folder, create a file called styles.css. This page will contain the projects css styles
- In styles.css file:
  - Apply background color styles to the nav menu
  - Apply styles for the main container so that there's a space between the navbar and the main content
  ```css
  body {
    background-color: #eaeaea;
  }

  .ui.fixed.menu {
    background-image: linear-gradient(
      135deg,
      rgb(24, 42, 115) 0%,
      rgb(33, 138, 174) 69%,
      rgb(32, 167, 172) 89%
    );
  }

  .ui.main.container {
    margin-top: 7em;
  }
  ```

### [3. Create Event List Items: EventList, EventListItem, and EventListAttendee components](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/b3a0b071ecc2d52f68dd7d20abc129d1b0fb60c6)
- In the EventDashboard 10-column grid section, create and display the details of event list item that includes the title of the event, who is hosting the event, date, venue, description of the event, a button to view the event detail, and list of attendees
- In features/events/eventDashboard folder, create a component/file called EventList.jsx
- In EventList.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import the EventListItem component: `import EventListItem from './EventListItem';`
  - Write an EventList functional component that renders the EventListItem component several times

  export default function EventList() {
    return (
      <>
        <EventListItem />
        <EventListItem />
        <EventListItem />
        <EventListItem />
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
- In features/events/eventDashboard folder, create a component/file called EventListItem.jsx
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic components: `import { Button, Icon, Item, List, Segment } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Import the EventListAttendee component: `import EventListAttendee from './EventListAttendee';`
  - Write an EventListItem functional component that renders the list item details using Semantic UI
    - Render several EventListAttendee components
  ```javascript
  export default function EventListItem() {
    return (
      <Segment.Group>
        <Segment>
          <Item.Group>
            <Item>
              <Item.Image size='tiny' circular src='/assets/user.png' />
              <Item.Content>
                <Item.Header content='Event Title' />
                <Item.Description>Hosted by Bob</Item.Description>
              </Item.Content>
            </Item>
          </Item.Group>
        </Segment>

        <Segment>
          <span>

            Venue
          </span>
        </Segment>

        <Segment secondary>
          <List horizontal>
            <EventListAttendee />
            <EventListAttendee />
            <EventListAttendee />
          </List>
        </Segment>

        <Segment clearing>
          <div>Description of event</div>
          <Button color='teal' floated='right' content='View' />
        </Segment>
      </Segment.Group>
    );
  }
  ```
- In features/events/eventDashboard folder, create a component/file called EventListAttendee.jsx
- In EventListAttendee.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic Image and List components: `import { Image, List } from 'semantic-ui-react';`

    return (
      <List.Item>
        <Image size='mini' circular src='/assets/user.png' />
      </List.Item>
    );
  }
  ```
- In the EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import the EventList component: `import EventList from './EventList';`
  - Render the EventList component inside the 10-column Grid component
  ```javascript
  <Grid.Column width={10}>
    <EventList />
  </Grid.Column>
  ```

### [4. Create an Event Form: EventForm component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/272b9350f7e519237003ce1cf993d2588de949b9)
- In features/events/eventForm folder, create a component/file called EventForm.jsx
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic components: `import { Button, Form, Header, Segment } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write an EventForm functional component that renders a form using Semantic UI to create an event
    ```javascript
    export default function EventForm() {
      return (
        <Segment clearing>
          <Header content='Create new event' />
          <Form>
            <Form.Field>
              <input type='text' placeholder='Event Title' />
            </Form.Field>
            <Form.Field>
              <input type='text' placeholder='Category' />
            </Form.Field>
            <Form.Field>
              <input type='text' placeholder='Description' />
            </Form.Field>
            <Form.Field>
              <input type='text' placeholder='City' />
            </Form.Field>
            <Form.Field>
              <input type='text' placeholder='Venue' />
            </Form.Field>
            <Form.Field>
              <input type='date' placeholder='Date' />
            </Form.Field>
            <Button type='submit' floated='right' positive content='Submit' />
            <Button type='submit' floated='right' content='Cancel' />
          </Form>
        </Segment>
      );
    }
    ```
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import the EventForm component: `import EventForm from '../eventForm/EventForm';`
  - Render the component inside the 6-column Grid component
  ```javascript
  <Grid.Column width={6}>
    <EventForm />
  </Grid.Column>
  ```

### [5. Passing props down to child components](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/24ca77efdcca7981a8a83760119daee83e6e00ae)
- In src/app/api foler, there's a sampleData.js file which contains sample data of events that we can use display events information
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import the sample data file: `import { sampleData } from '../../../app/api/sampleData';`
  - The EventDashboard component is a parent of the EventList component. Parent can pass properties/props down to child components
  - Pass the events props to the EventList child component and assign its value to sampleData
    - `<EventList events={sampleData} />`
- In EventList.jsx file:
  - To receive properties/props being passed down from the parent component, simply take `props` as an argument
    - `export default function EventList(props) { ... }`
  - Now the EventList component has assess to the events sample data by using the `props.events` notation
  - We can further destructure the events object from props
    - `export default function EventList({ events }) { ... }`
  - Loop over the events array using the .map() method and pass down the event item, as event props, to the EventListItem component
  ```javascript
  export default function EventList({ events }) {
    return (
      <>
        {events.map((event) => (
          <EventListItem event={event} key={event.id} />
        ))}
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - Receive the event props as an argument from EventList parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventListItem({ event }) { ... }`
  - Now we can update the event generic detail information with the event properties, which have the sample data
  - To display the list of attendees, loop through the event.attendees array using the .map() method and pass down the attendee item, as attendee props, to the EventListAttendee child component
  ```javascript
  export default function EventListItem({ event }) {
    return (
      <Segment.Group>
        <Segment>
          <Item.Group>
            <Item>
              <Item.Image size='tiny' circular src={event.hostPhotoURL} />
              <Item.Content>
                <Item.Header content={event.title} />
                <Item.Description>Hosted by {event.hostedBy}</Item.Description>
              </Item.Content>
            </Item>
          </Item.Group>
        </Segment>

        <Segment>
          <span>
            <Icon name='clock' /> {event.date}
            <Icon name='marker' />
            {event.venue.address}
          </span>
        </Segment>

        <Segment secondary>
          <List horizontal>
            {event.attendees.map((attendee) => (
              <EventListAttendee attendee={attendee} key={attendee.id} />
            ))}
          </List>
        </Segment>

        <Segment clearing>
          <div>{event.description}</div>
          <Button color='teal' floated='right' content='View' />
        </Segment>
      </Segment.Group>
    );
  }
  ```
- In EventListAttendee.jsx file:
  - Receive the attendee props as an argument from EventListItem parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventListAttendee({ attendee }) { ... }`
  - Replace the image source with `attendee.photoURL`
  ```javascript
  export default function EventListAttendee({ attendee }) {
    return (
      <List.Item>
        <Image size='mini' circular src={attendee.photoURL} />
      </List.Item>
    );
  }
  ```

### [6. React component state: React useState hook](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/c6373f8c591eae387fc1fd21a683451386b94e48)
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import react useState hook: `import React, { useState } from 'react';`
  - Create an events state and initialize its value to sampleData. Now the events state holds the data sample coming from the dataSample.js file
    - `const [events, setEvents] = useState(sampleData);`
  - For the events props that we pass down to the EventList child component, we can assign its value to events state
    - `<EventList events={events} />`
- Now let's work on showing and hiding the event form based on the state. When the "Create Event" button in the NavBar is clicked, we want to display the EventForm. When the "Cancel" button in the EventForm is clicked, we want to hide the EventForm
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import react useState hook: `import React, { useState } from 'react';`
  - Create a formOpen state and initialize it to false
    - `const [formOpen, setFormOpen] = useState(false);`
  - Pass the setFormOpen method down as props to the NavBar child component. The NavBar component will comsume this method, setting the state to true, when the 'Create Event' button is clicked. This will trigger the EventForm component to display in the EventDashboard component
    - `<NavBar setFormOpen={setFormOpen} />`
  - Pass the formOpen state and setFormOpen method down as props to the EventDashboard component
    - `<EventDashboard formOpen={formOpen} setFormOpen={setFormOpen} />` 
  ```javascript
  export default function App() {
    const [formOpen, setFormOpen] = useState(false);

    return (
      <>
        <NavBar setFormOpen={setFormOpen} />
        <Container className='main'>
          <EventDashboard formOpen={formOpen} setFormOpen={setFormOpen} />
        </Container>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
- In the NavBar.jsx file:
  - Receive the setFormOpen props as an argument from App parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function NavBar({ setFormOpen }) { ... }`
  - In the 'Create Event' button element
    - Add an onClick event that will execute the setFormOpen method when the button is clicked
    - Execute the setFormOpen method inside an arrow/anonymous function and pass in true as an argument
    - We execute the setFormOpen method inside an arrow function because we want to call setFormOpen() only when the button is clicked. We don't want to execute setFormOpn() when the NavBar component loads
    - `<Button onClick={() => setFormOpen(true)} positive inverted content='Create Event' />`
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Receive the formOpen and setFormOpen props as an argument from App parent component and destructure them
    - `export default function EventDashboard({ formOpen, setFormOpen }) { ... }`
  - Pass the setFormOpen method down as props to the EventForm child component. The EventForm component will comsume this method, setting the state to false, when the 'Cancel' button is clicked
  - We can show or hide the event form based on the state
    - `{formOpen && <EventForm setFormOpen={setFormOpen} />}`
    - Whatever is on the left of && is true, do whatever is on the right of &&
    - Only display the EventForm component if formOpen state is true
    - This means that when the when the 'Create Event' in the NavBar is clicked, formOpen state is true and EventForm will display
    - When the 'Cancel' button in the EventForm component is clicked, formOpen state is false and EventForm will not display
  ```javascript
  export default function EventDashboard({ formOpen, setFormOpen }) {
    const [events, setEvents] = useState(sampleData);

    return (
      <Grid>
        <Grid.Column width={10}>
          <EventList events={events} />
        </Grid.Column>
        <Grid.Column width={6}>
          {formOpen && <EventForm setFormOpen={setFormOpen} />}
        </Grid.Column>
      </Grid>
    );
  }
  ```
- In the EventForm.jsx file:
  - Receive the setFormOpen props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventForm({ setFormOpen }) { ... }`
  - In the 'Cancel' button element
    - Add an onClick event and execute the setFormOpen() method inside an arrow function and set it to false
    ```javascript
    <Button
      onClick={() => setFormOpen(false)}
      type='submit'
      floated='right'
      content='Cancel'
    />
    ```


## CRUD OPERATIONS IN REACT
- Controlled Components
  - No direct access to the DOM
  - So no access to Input
  - Only concerned with altering State
  - Rely on React to manipuate the DOM via the Virtual DOM

### [1. Basic forms in React: EventForm](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/d59ad986c0fb657e35b14acf5aa43da536e99f25)
- Enable the EventForm component to receive input values from the user and update the values state with the input values
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Since we're going to be updating events, we're going to be updating them in events state. So we want to pass down the setEvents method as props to the EventForm child component 
    - `<EventForm setFormOpen={setFormOpen} setEvents={setEvents} />`
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Receive the setEvents props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventForm({ setEvents }) { ... }`
  - Create an initialValues object with initial empty-value properties
    ```javascript
    const initialValues = {
      title: '',
      category: '',
      description: '',
      city: '',
      venu: '',
      date: ''
    };
    ```
  - Create a values state and initialize its value to the initialValues object. Note that this values state is an object
    - `const [values, setValues] = useState(initialValues);`
  - In the Form element, the handleFormSubmit method is executed when the onSubmit event is triggered. Meaning, when the Submit button is clicked
    - `<Form onSubmit={handleFormSubmit}>`
  - For each Form input element, the handleInputChange method is executed when the input value changes via the onChange event being triggered
    - add name, value, and onChange properties to each form input element
    ```javascript
    <Form.Field>
      <input
        type='text'
        placeholder='Event Title'
        name='title'
        value={values.title}
        onChange={(e) => handleInputChange(e)}
      />
    </Form.Field>
    ```
  - Write a handleInputChange method that updates the values state with the input values
    - It takes the input event as argument
    - Each input element has name and value properties, so we can destructure those from e.target
    - Update the values state with the input values based on its name and value properties
    ```javascript
    function handleInputChange(e) {
      const { name, value } = e.target;
      setValues({ ...values, [name]: value });
    }
    ```
  - Write a handleFormSubmit method that creates an event
    - Console log the values state for now
    ```javascript
    function handleFormSubmit() {
      console.log(values);
    }
    ```

### [2. Creating an event, cuid](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/2bb226ab6206c86192a3cfe93e72d9a0bea5bc0d)
- We create a new event by updating the events state with the new event. Do this by creating a method and pass in the values state which comes from the form input values
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Write a handleCreateEvent method that adds a new event received to the events state using the setEvents() method
    - It takes event as an argument
    - Note that the events state is an array. So when we call the setEvents(), we add the new event to an array
    ```javascript
    function handleCreateEvent(event) {
      setEvents([...events, event]);
    }
    ```
  - Then pass down this handleCreateEvent method as createEvent props to the EventForm child component
    - `<EventForm createEvent={handleCreateEvent} />`
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Receive the createEvent props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventForm({ createEvent }) { ... }`
  - In the handleFormSubmit() method
    - Execute the createEvent method and pass in the values state as argument
    ```javascript
    function handleFormSubmit() {
      createEvent(values);
    }
    ```
- Now, when we hit form submit to create a new event, we will run into 2 errors
  - First is, we don't have a unique event id. In the EventList component, when we're mapping over the events array, it's expecting to find an event.id for eachh event
  - Second is, our values object state does not have an attendees property. Since the attendees array is not defined and the .map() method is called on it, we get an error
  - Solution: need to provide the event an id and an array of attendees
- Install a cuid package, a unique identifier: `npm install cuid`
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import the cuid: `import cuid from 'cuid';`
  - In the handleFormSubmit() method:
    - What we provide to the createEvent() method is the existing values state object, plus an id property with the cuid value
      - Also add a hostedBy property. Set a default string value for now
      - Also add an attendees property. Set it to an empty array for now
      - Also add a hostPhotoURL property. Set it to a static image for now
    - Lastly, once the form has been submitted to create an event, we want to close the form. Do this by calling the setFormOpen() method and set it to false 
    ```javascript
    function handleFormSubmit() {
      createEvent({
        ...values,
        id: cuid(),
        hostedBy: 'Bob',
        attendees: [],
        hostPhotoURL: '/assets/user.png'
      });
      setFormOpen(false);
    }
    ```

### [3. Selecting an event to read](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/d28c750f8fcd34592db9f9d04b3e5e56c24e823a)
- When we click on the 'View' button on an event, it opens up the event form and populates the values from the event inside the form as well. We need to create a selectedEvent state to store the selected event values. And depending on the condition of this state, we can either show an empty form or a form with the values from the event
- In App.jsx file:
  - Create a selectedEvent state and give its initial value of null
    - `const [selectedEvents, setSelectedEvent] = useState(null);`
  - Write a handleSelectEvent method that sets the selectedEvent state to the event and opens the EventForm
    - It takes event as an argument
  - Write a handleCreateFormOpen method that sets the selectedEvent to null and opens the EventForm
    - It doesn't take any arguments
  - Pass down the handleCreateFormOpen method as setFormOpen props to the NavBar child component
  - For the EventDashboard child component, we pass down the handleSelectEvent method and the selectedEvent state as props
  ```javascript
  export default function App() {
    const [formOpen, setFormOpen] = useState(false);
    const [selectedEvent, setSelectedEvent] = useState(null);

    function handleSelectEvent(event) {
      setSelectedEvent(event);
      setFormOpen(true);
    }

    function handleCreateFormOpen() {
      setSelectedEvent(null);
      setFormOpen(true);
    }

    return (
      <>
        <NavBar setFormOpen={handleCreateFormOpen} />
        <Container className='main'>
          <EventDashboard
            formOpen={formOpen}
            setFormOpen={setFormOpen}
            selectEvent={handleSelectEvent}
            selectedEvent={selectedEvent}
          />
        </Container>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Receive the selectEvent and selectedEvent props as an argument from App parent component and destructure them
    - `export default function EventDashboard({ selectEvent, selectedEvent }) {...}`
  - Pass down the selectEvent method as selectEvent props to the EventList child component
    - `<EventList events={events} selectEvent={selectEvent} />`
  - Pass down the selectedEvent state as selectedEvent props to the EventForm child component. This way we can see the selected form
    - `<EventForm selectedEvent={selectedEvent} />`
- In EventList.jsx file:
  - Receive the selectEvent props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventList({ events, selectEvent }) {...}`
  - Pass down this props as selectEvent props to the EventListItem child component
    - `<EventListItem event={event} key={event.id} selectEvent={selectEvent} />`
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - Receive the selectEvent props as an argument from EventList parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventListItem({ event, selectEvent }) {...}`
  - In the 'View' Button element:
    - Add an onClick event property that executes the selectEvent() method when the 'View' button is clicked
    - Call the selectEvent() method inside an arrow function and pass in the event as argument
    ```javascript
    <Button
      onClick={() => selectEvent(event)}
      color='teal'
      floated='right'
      content='View'
    />
    ```
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Receive the selectedEvent props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventForm({ selectedEvent }) {...}`
  - We're going to use the ?? null conditional operator to check if the selectedEvent state is null
    - If selectedEvent state is null, then we pass anything to the right of ??. This means that the initialValues is set to the empty-string object
    - If selectedEvent state is NOT null, then the initialValues is set to the selectedEvent state values
    - Remember that when the 'View' button is clicked, the setSelectedEvent() method is called to set the event values to the selectedEvent state
  ```javascript
	const initialValues = selectedEvent ?? {
		title: '',
		category: '',
		description: '',
		city: '',
		venu: '',
		date: ''
	};
  ```

### [4. Controlled components with a key: EventForm](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/caedc6622fc8a3b9a06844a343b349e1d3a28afe)
- The current problem we have is that when we click on the 'View' button to view a different event or click on the 'Create Event' button to create a new event, nothing causes the page to re-render so nothing happens. Behind the scene, however, the EventForm component does have the correct information in props when one of those buttons are clicked
- When we send new props to a component, it does not cause the component to be re-rendered. The work-around solution is to use the special React attibute called key. We can add a key property to a component. So when the key changes, the component will be recreated with a freshly initialized state
- So we're going to give our EventForm component a key
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - For the EventForm child component, add a key property
  - For the key value, we first check to see if we have a selected event in selectedEvent state, if selectedEvent is not null
    - If it's not null, set the key value to selectedEvent.id
    - If it's null, then set the key to be null itself
  - `<EventForm key={selectedEvent ? selectedEvent.id : null} />`
- Lastly, if the selected event form is opened, we want the form title to say 'Edit the event'. If it's a new event form, the form title should say 'Create new event'
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - In the Header element, add a conditional to display one or the other
  - `<Header content={selectedEvent ? 'Edit the event' : 'Create new event'} />`

### [5. Updating an event](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/745b8c9c52963a568cd057a9edac0429bc1a8876)
- We can update an event in the events state by check the updatedEvent id with the event id in the events state. If it matches, we can update the event with the new values. Write a method to handle the update event
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Write a handleUpdateEvent method that updates an event in the events state based on the event id. Also sets the selectedEvent back to null and closes the form
    - This method takes an updatedEvent as argument
    - Use the setEvents() method to set the events state with the updated event, if the updatedEvent id matches with the event id in the events state
    - Use the selectEvent() method to set the selectedEvent state back to null
    ```javascript
    function handleUpdateEvent(updatedEvent) {
      setEvents(
        events.map((evt) => (evt.id === updatedEvent.id ? updatedEvent : evt))
      );
      selectEvent(null);
    }
    ```
  - Pass down this handleUpdateEvent method as updateEvent props to the EventForm child component
    - `<EventForm updateEvent={handleUpdateEvent} />`
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Receive the updateEvent props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventForm({ updateEvent }) {...}`
  - In the handleFormSubmit() method:
    - Use a ternary operator to check if selectedEvent state is not null
    - If it's not null, call the updateEvent() method. What we give to the method is the all the current values in selectedEvent state, plus the updated values that's replacing the values in selectedEvent state
    - If it's null, then call the createEvent() method
    ```javascript
    function handleFormSubmit() {
      selectedEvent
        ? updateEvent({ ...selectedEvent, ...values })
        : createEvent({
            ...values,
            id: cuid(),
            hostedBy: 'Bob',
            attendees: [],
            hostPhotoURL: '/assets/user.png'
          });
      setFormOpen(false);
    }
    ```

### [6. Deleting an event](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/90f0177ee2920870a61950e9ac17fac2eaa4b54d)
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Write a handleDeleteEvent method removes an event from the events state based on its id
    - This method takes an eventId as argument
    - Call the setEvents() method to update the events state
    - Use the .filter() method on events to filter out all the events that does not match the eventId, hence removes the event that matches
    ```javascript
    function handleDeleteEvent(eventId) {
      setEvents(events.filter((evt) => evt.id !== eventId));
    }
    ```
  - Pass down this handleDeleteEvent method as deleteEvent props to the EventList child component
    - `<EventList deleteEvent={handleDeleteEvent} />`
- In EventList.jsx file:
  - Receive the deleteEvent props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventList({ deleteEvent }) {...}`
  - Pass down this DeleteEvent method as deleteEvent props to the EventListItem child component
    - `<EventListItem deleteEvent={deleteEvent} />`
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - Receive the deleteEvent props as an argument from EventList parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventListItem({ deleteEvent }) {...}`  
  - In the render section
    - Create a 'Delete' Button element
    - In the Delete Button element, add an onClick event property that executes the deleteEvent() method when the 'Delete' button is clicked
    - Call the deleteEvent() method inside an arrow function and pass in the event.id
    ```javascript
    <Button
      onClick={() => deleteEvent(event.id)}
      color='red'
      floated='right'
      content='Delete'
    />
    ```


## ROUTING IN REACT
- We will be using React Route 5
- React Router is broken into 3 packages:
  - react-router
  - react-router-dom
  - react-router-native
- React-router-dom and react-router-native re-export all of react-router. React-router contains all of the main functionality. So we only need to install react-router-dom and we get all of the react-router functionality
- The Router
  - `<BrowserRouter>`
    - Handle dynamic requests
  - `<HashRouter>`
    - Static websites
  - Can only have a single child component
  - Surround our `<App />` to work with this limitation
- History
  - The history object is part of the browser. Every browser has a history object
  - The way the routing system works is it uses a history object which:
    - Keeps track of the current location
    - Re-renders whenever that changes
  - The history object comes with a number of methods
    - What we typically do is use the push() method to push a new route into history and this will cause the component to re-render and display what it is we're routing to on the page
  
**Install react-router-dom**
  - Install: `npm i react-router-dom`

### [1. Adding HomePage and EventDetailedPage components](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/061fb0b89a7c9d8203a5d74481a24e8432b0fb34)
- In features folder, create a new folder called home. In home folder, create a component/file called HomePage.jsx
- In HomePage.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Write a HomePage functional component that renders a 'Homeage' text for now
- In features/events folder, create a new folder called eventDetailed. In eventDetailed folder, create a component/file called EventDetailedPage.jsx
- In EventDetailedPage.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Write a EventDetailedPage functional component that render a 'Event Detailed Page' text for now
  
### [2. Routing configuration](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/cae6e12df81c38d04631a02efb82f84b34d78c13)
- Website: https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start
- In index.js file:
  - Import BrowserRouter component: `import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Wrap the App component inside the BrowserRouter component
  ```javascript
  function render() {
    ReactDOM.render(
      <BrowserRouter>
        <App />
      </BrowserRouter>,
      rootEl
    );
  }
  ```
- So now our App component has routing capability. We can setup the routes inside there
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import the Route component: `import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Create routes using the Route component for HomePage, EventDashboard, EventDetailedPage, and EventForm components. Each route has a unique path
  ```javascript
  <Container className='main'>
    <Route path='/' exact component={HomePage} />
    <Route path='/events' exact component={EventDashboard} />
    <Route path='/events/:id' exact component={EventDetailedPage} />
    <Route path='/createEvent' exact component={EventForm} />
  </Container>
  ```

### [3. Using NavLinks and Links](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/340a5eb413db17ecea97ca3e41277a8c9d162f2a)
- `<NavLink>` is a special version of the `<Link>` that will add styling attribute to the rendered element when it matches the current URL. It adds an activeClass and applies styles to a link
- In NavBar.jsx file:
  - Import the NavLink component: `import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - For Semantic UI components, we can use an 'as' property and give its value the name of another component that we want the Semantic component to act as
  - In our case, we want the Semantic `<Menu.Item>` to act as a `<NavLink>` component. Then we can pass in properties that the `<NavLink>` is expecting, such as the 'to' property pathname and 'exact'
  - Note that we no longer use the onClick event for the 'Create Event' button to direct user to the EventForm. We can use the NavLink instead
  ```javascript
  <Menu.Item as={NavLink} exact to='/' header>
    <img src='/assets/logo.png' alt='logo' style={{ marginRight: 15 }} />
    Revents
  </Menu.Item>
  <Menu.Item as={NavLink} to='/events' name='Events' />
  <Menu.Item as={NavLink} to='/createEvent'>
    <Button positive inverted content='Create Event' />
  </Menu.Item>
  ```

### [4. Home page styling](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/355436ff155aec6180cb144af79f7541d221e25c)
- We don't want the NavBar to show when we're on home page. We want something that takes up the entire screen and provide a button that takes us to the events page
- In HomePage.jsx file:
  - Add content and styles to the page using Semantic UI
  ```javascript
  export default function HomePage() {
    return (
      <Segment inverted textAlign='center' vertical className='masthead'>
        <Container>
          <Header as='h1' inverted>
            <Image
              size='massive'
              src='/assets/logo.png'
              style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}
            />
            Re-vents
          </Header>
          <Button size='huge' inverted>
            Get started
            <Icon name='right arrow' inverted />
          </Button>
        </Container>
      </Segment>
    );
  }
  ```
- In styles.css file:
  - Add styles to the home page
  ```css
  .masthead {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    background-image: linear-gradient(
      135deg,
      rgb(24, 42, 115) 0%,
      rgb(33, 138, 174) 69%,
      rgb(32, 167, 172) 89%
    ) !important;
    height: 100vh;
  }

  .masthead h1.ui.header {
    font-size: 4em;
  }
  ```
- In App.jsx file:
  - For the HomePage to appear outside of the NavBar and Container components, we need create another route that renders the NavBar and Container separately from the HomePage
  - This new route takes a path with an expression that says, anything after the / forward slash plus something else, render it differently
  - This new route also takes a render property rather an a component property. This render property takes a function. And inside this function, we can render the NavBar and the Container components. Wrap it inside a fragment tag because it only allows one child component
  ```javascript
	return (
		<>
			<Route path='/' exact component={HomePage} />
			<Route
				path={'/(.+)'}
				render={() => (
					<>
						<NavBar setFormOpen={handleCreateFormOpen} />
						<Container className='main'>
							<Route path='/' exact component={HomePage} />
							<Route path='/events' exact component={EventDashboard} />
							<Route path='/events/:id' exact component={EventDetailedPage} />
							<Route path='/createEvent' exact component={EventForm} />
						</Container>
					</>
				)}
			/>
		</>
	);
  ```
- Since the HomePage component is inside a `<Route>`, we have access to the routing properties. This is props being passed down to the HomePage component. One of these props is the history object. We can use the history.push() method to push another route onto the history object and push the user to that particular route
- In HomePage.jsx file:
  - Receive the history object props as an argument and destructure it
    - `export default function HomePage({ history }) {...}`
  - In the 'Get started' Button element:
    - Add an onClick event property and execute the history.push() method to direct user to a different route when the button is clicked
    - Call the history.push() method inside an arrow function and pass in the pathname as the argument
    ```javascript
    <Button onClick={() => history.push('/events')} size='huge' inverted>
      Get started
      <Icon name='right arrow' inverted />
    </Button>
    ```

### [5. Adding menus for authenticated and unauthenticated users](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/0575d4b7e86a8aa1f19973639988fa7dbce51572)
- We're not going to implement any user authentication at this point. We're just going to give the user the ability to fake a login or not login for now
- In features/nav folder, create components/files called SignedInMenu.jsx and SignedOutMenu.jsx
- In SignedOutMenu.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic components: `import { Button, Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write a SignedOutMenu functional component that renders the 'Login' and 'Register' buttons
    - Cut and paste the 'Login' and 'Register' Button elements from NavBar.jsx file
    ```javascript
    export default function SignedOutMenu() {
      return (
        <Menu.Item position='right'>
          <Button basic inverted content='Login' />
          <Button
            basic
            inverted
            content='Register'
            style={{ marginLeft: '0.5em' }}
          />
        </Menu.Item>
      );
    }
    ```
- In SignedInMenu.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Link component: `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Import Semantic compontnets: `import { Dropdown, Image, Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write a SignedInMenu functional component that renders a user already signed in dropdown menu. Usee Semantic UI
    ```javascript
    export default function SignedInMenu() {
      return (
        <Menu.Item position='right'>
          <Image avatar spaced='right' src="/assets/user.png" />
          <Dropdown pointing='top left' text='Bob'>
            <Dropdown.Menu>
              <Dropdown.Item as={Link} to='/createEvent' text='Create Event' icon='plus' />
              <Dropdown.Item text='My profile' icon='user' />
              <Dropdown.Item text='Sign out' icon='power' />
            </Dropdown.Menu>
          </Dropdown>
        </Menu.Item>
      );
    }
    ```
- In NavBar.jsx file:
  - Import the SignedOutMenu component: `import SignedOutMenu from './SignedOutMenu';`
  - Import the SignedInMenu component: `import SignedInMenu from './SignedInMenu';`
  - Call the SignedOutMenu component in the render section: `<SignedOutMenu />`
  - Call the SignedInMenu component in the render section: `<SignedInMenu />`

### [6. Adding fake authentication](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/f78df90a17805f3fdef3131ce72557b028230e72)
- For now, we'll use local states in our NavBar component to check if a user is authenticated or not. If the user is authenticated, they get to see the 'Create Event' button and the SignedInMenu appears. If not authenticated, they won't see the 'Create Event' button and the SignedOutMenu appears
- In NavBar.jsx file:
  - Create an authenticated state and set it to false as its initial value state
    - `const [authenticated, setAuthenticated] = useState(false);`
  - In the render section:
    - Write a ternary operator to check if a user is authenticated
      - If authenticated, show the `<SignedInMenu />` component
      - If not authenticated, show the `<SignedOutMenu />` component
      - `{authenticated ? <SignedInMenu /> : <SignedOutMenu />}`
    - Use the && operator to show the 'Create Event' Button/Link only if the user is authenticated
      ```javascript
      {authenticated && (
        <Menu.Item as={NavLink} to='/createEvent'>
          <Button positive inverted content='Create Event' />
        </Menu.Item>
      )}
      ```
  - Pass down the setAuthenticated method as setAuthenticated props to both SignedInMenu and SignedOutMenu components
    - `<SignedInMenu setAuthenticated={setAuthenticated} />`
    - `<SignedOutMenu setAuthenticated={setAuthenticated} />`
- In the SignedOutMenu.jsx file:
  - Receive the setAuthenticated props from the NavBar parent component and destructure it
  - In the 'Login' Button element:
    - Add an onClick event property and execute the setAuthenticated() method and set it to true
    - When the 'Login' button is clicked, the 'Create Event' button appears on the NavBar and switch to the SignedInMenu
    - `<Button onClick={() => setAuthenticated(true)} />`
- In the SignedInMenu.jsx file:
  - Receive the setAuthenticated props from the NavBar parent component and destructure it
  - In the 'Sign out' Dropdown.Item:
    - Add an onClick event property and execute the setAuthenticated() method and set it to false
    - So when the 'Sign out' dropdown is clicked, the 'Create Event' button will not show on the NavBar and switch to the SignedOutMenu
    - `<Dropdown.Item onClick={() => setAuthenticated(false)} text='Sign out' icon='power' />`

### [7. Using the useHistory hook](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/935a2b00f8f4c3348b938a73e015dab31a84eddb)
- Since the NavBar component is not in a Route component, it doesn't have access to the browser history object. So we can't use the history.push() method to push the user to a new route. React-router comes with a useHistory hook that we can utilize
- When the authenticated user clicks the 'Sign out' button, it'll direct them to the homepage
- In NavBar.jsx file:
  - Import useHistory hook: `import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Create a history using the useHistory() hook
    - `const history = useHistory();`
  - And now we have access to the history object, just like a routed component does
  - Write a handleSignOut method that logs out the user
    - This method sets the authenticated state to false using the setAuthenticated() method
    - And push the user to home page using the history.push() method
    ```javascript
    function handleSignOut() {
      setAuthenticated(false);
      history.push('/');
    }
    ```
  - Pass down this handleSignOut method as signOut props to the SignedInMenu child component
    - `<SignedInMenu signOut={handleSignOut} />`
- In SignedInMenu.jsx file:
  - Receive the signOut method props from the NavBar parent component and destructure it
  - In the 'Sign out' DropDown.Item, call the signOut method on the onClick event property. We don't need to use the setAuthenticated() method anymore
  - `<Dropdown.Item onClick={signOut} text='Sign out' icon='power' />`

### [8. EventDetailedPage structure: create smaller comps](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/6aebc9fbdc62fb8ff0ce5c03ec8860b5ba4baa70)
- The Event Detailed Page is significant and will have many features and functionalities. We'll break these into smaller components and render them onto the EventDetailedPage component
- In the features/events/eventDetailed folder, create the following components/files:
  - EventDetailedHeader.jsx
  - EventDetailedInfo.jsx
  - EventDetailedChat.jsx
  - EventDetailedSidebar.jsx
- Write a simple functional component for each of the above and render a simple title text
- In EventDetailedPage.jsx file:
  - Import Semantic Grid component: `import { Grid } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Create the page layout using the Semantic UI Grid and place in the above components
  ```javascript
  export default function EventDetailedPage() {
    return (
      <Grid>
        <Grid.Column width={10}>
          <EventDetailedHeader />
          <EventDetailedInfo />
          <EventDetailedChat />
        </Grid.Column>

        <Grid.Column width={6}>
          <EventDetailedSidebar />
        </Grid.Column>
      </Grid>
    );
  }
  ```
- Now in the EventListItem component, when a user clicks on the 'View' event button, we can direct them to the EventDetailedPage of that event using the Link component
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - Import the Link component: `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Use the 'as' property to make the Button element act as a Link
  - Use the 'to' property to set the pathname of the link
  ```javascript
  <Button
    as={Link}
    to={`/events/${event.id}`}
    color='teal'
    floated='right'
    content='View'
  />
  ```

### [9. EventDetailedPage content](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/2f6acb36ea87deeb87078ef3ec76a9cfbdccdfe7)
- Add content and styles to the following components:
  - EventDetailedHeader.jsx
  - EventDetailedInfo.jsx
  - EventDetailedChat.jsx
  - EventDetailedSidebar.jsx


## INTRO TO REDUX
**What is Redux?**
- Predictable State Container for Javascript apps. This allows us to store our applications states centrally in a Redux store 
- Not specific to React
  - Can be use with other view libraries and JS frameworks (Angular, Vue)
- It's small - 2kb (including dependencies)
- It's like having a local database in the client
- Gives us access to time travel debugging

**Redux Trade Offs - it asks use to:**
- Describe application state as plain objects and arrays. We can add complex objects to our store. It's not relational database on the client-side. It's a simple state management system
- Describe changes in the system as plain objects. So when we want to make a change to our store, then we send Redux, a plain object with the information inside it, that we want it to change
- Describle the logic for handling changes as *pure functions*. This will keep our code clean!

**Pure Functions**
- Given the same input, will always return the same output
- Produces no side effects

**Redux Terminology**
- **Actions:** are simple objects. Typically when we create an action, we create a constant and this constant is going to describe what the action is going to do
  ```javascript
  const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'

  {
    type: ADD_TODO,
    text: 'build my first Redux app'
  }
  ```
- **Action Creators:** a function that returns an action. We wrap an action inside an action creator
  ```javascript
  function addTodo(text) {
    return {
      type: ADD_TODO,
      text
    }
  }
  ```
- **Reducers:** specifies how the application state changes in response to actions sent to the store. We send our action to the reducer. Actions, themselves, they only describe what's happen, but don't describe how the application state changes
  - Reducers usually uses a switch statement to change the store state
  ```javascript
  function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {
    switch(action.type) {
      case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:
        return Object.assign({}, state, {
          visibilityFilter: action.filter
        })
      default:
        return state
    }
  }
  ```

- **Store:**
  - Holds application store
  - Allows access to state via getState()
  - Allows state to be updated via actions
  - One store per application

**React Redux**
- Redux on its own has no relation to React
- Redux can be used with Angular, Ember, jQuery or plain JS
- React-Redux library provides bindings for use with React
  - Provider, which provides a store to a React application
- It also provides React-Redux hooks:
  - useSelector() - listening to changes in the store and notifies the React component
  - useDispatch() - dispatches an action to the reducer

**Setting up Redux**
- Configure the Store
- Create a root reducer
- Add the store to the index.js file. Then we pass the store via the Provider to our application

**Install Redux and React-Redux**
- Run: `npm i redux react-redux`

**Install Redux Dev Tools**
- Install: `npm i redux-devtools-extension --save-dev`
- In configureStore.jsx file:
  - Import the devToolsEnhencer method: `import { devToolsEnhancer } from 'redux-devtools-extension';`
  - Pass in the devToolsEnhancer to the createStore() method as 2nd argument
  ```javascript
  export function configureStore() {
    return createStore(testReducer, devToolsEnhancer());
  }
  ```
- Now whenever a React app uses Redux, you can see the store state changes based on the actions using the dev tools

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A TASTE OF REDUX

### [Setting up Redux, Redux sandbox](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/8b49fa7a966930ddfb44a3642ac088eddc12f6dd)
**The Reducer Function**
- The reducer function takes two arguments:
  - 1st arg is the initial state in the store
  - Note that a state can be an object or an array. Our initialState is an object. Hence, the initial state that we pass in to the reducer function is a state object
  - 2nd arg is the action
  - An action is an object and it has a type and payload properties
  - We can destructure the type and payload properties from the action in the 2nd arg
- The reducer function usually uses a switch statement to check for the action type. It tries to find that particular action type and returns with the updated state
  - Now, we never want to mutate the state itself. Instead, we return the initial state and only update a property in the state. In this case, we want to increase or decrease the data state based on the type of action we send to the reducer
- Also in a reducer function, we always want to return a default state, because we might not find an action type we're looking for
  ```javascript
  const initialState = {
    data: 42
  };

  export default function testReducer(state = initialState, {type, payload}) {
    switch (type) {
      case INCREMENT_COUNTER:
        return {
          ...state,
          data: state.data + payload
        };
      case DECREMENT_COUNTER:
        return {
          ...state,
          data: state.data - payload
        };
      default:
        return state;
    }
  }
  ```

**Action Creator**
- Is a function that takes in a payload data as an argument and returns the action object
  ```javascript
  // Action constant
  const INCREMENT_COUNTER = 'INCREMENT_COUNTER';
  const DECREMENT_COUNTER = 'DECREMENT_COUNTER';

  // Action creator
  export function increment(amount) {
    return {
      type: INCREMENT_COUNTER,
      payload: amount
    };
  }
  ```
- In our React component, when we dispatch an action by calling the dispatch() method, we can pass in this action creator function to the dispatch() method and provide the payload data

**In testReducer.jsx file:**
  ```javascript
  // Action constant
  const INCREMENT_COUNTER = 'INCREMENT_COUNTER';
  const DECREMENT_COUNTER = 'DECREMENT_COUNTER';

  // Action creator
  export function increment(amount) {
    return {
      type: INCREMENT_COUNTER,
      payload: amount
    };
  }

  // Action creator
  export function decrement(amount) {
    return {
      type: DECREMENT_COUNTER,
      payload: amount
    };
  }

  // Initial State
  const initialState = {
    data: 42
  };

  // Reducer function
  // 1st arg is initial state
  // 2nd arg is the action. Here, destructuring the properties from action object
  // Returning a default state
  export default function testReducer(state = initialState, {type, payload}) {
    switch (type) {
      case INCREMENT_COUNTER:
        return {
          ...state,
          data: state.data + payload
        };
      case DECREMENT_COUNTER:
        return {
          ...state,
          data: state.data - payload
        };
      default:
        return state;
    }
  }
  ```

**React component**
- Use the **useSelector()** hook to get a state from the redux store
  - The hook takes a selector function as an argument
  - The selector function is called with the store state and returns a particular state. In our case, we want the data state
  - `const data = useSelector((state) => state.data);`
  - Data is a property of the state object. We access the data state using the `state.data` notation. When we initialize the state in the reducer function, we initialized the state as an object. State can also be an array
- Use the **useDispatch()** hook to create a dispatch function. We can then use this dispatch() function to dispatch an action object or an action creator to the reducer
  - `const dispatch = useDispatch();`
- When the 'Increment' button is clicked, the dispatch() function is executed, sending an action to the reducer
  - The dispatch() function takes an action creator function as an argument
  - The action creator function is called with the payload data being passed in
  - `onClick={() => dispatch(increment(10))}` 
- In Sandbox.jsx file:
  ```javascript
  import React from 'react';
  import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
  import { Button } from 'semantic-ui-react';
  import { decrement, increment } from './testReducer';

  export default function SandBox() {
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    const data = useSelector((state) => state.data);
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Testing</h1>
        <h3>The data is: {data}</h3>
        <Button
          onClick={() => dispatch(increment(10))}
          content='Increment'
          color='green'
        />
        <Button
          onClick={() => dispatch(decrement(20))}
          content='Decrement'
          color='red'
        />
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### [1. Setting up Redux](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/df4369657b112b5029964fe6038265ddf5358170)
- **Install Redux and React-Redux:**
  - Install: `npm i redux react-redux`
- **Configure the store:**
  - In app folder, create a folder called store. In store folder, create a file called configureStore.js
  - In configureStore.js file:
    - Import createStore function from Redux: `import { createStore } from 'redux';`
    - Write a configureStore function that returns a store using the createStore() method
      - The createStore() method takes a reducer as an argument
      ```javascript
      export function configureStore() {
        return createStore();
      }
      ```
  - So when we initialize our store, we're going to tell about our reducer and our store is going to have some initialState
- **Connecting the React app to the Redux store:**
  - Now we what need to do is tell our React application about our new Redux store and to do that we use the React-Redux library
  - In index.js file:
    - Import the Provider from React-Redux: `import { Provider } from 'react-redux';`
    - Wrap the Provider around the App component, including the BrowserRouter
    - Then create a store by calling the configureStore() method that we wrote earlier
    - Pass in this store to the Provider
    - Now our React app is connect to the Redux store
    ```javascript
    const store = configureStore();

    function render() {
      ReactDOM.render(
        <Provider store={store}>
          <BrowserRouter>
            <App />
          </BrowserRouter>
        </Provider>,
        rootEl
      );
    }
    ```

### [2. Creating the event reducer](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/e4095fd69916f70f2de5ee9557744c169b425c4d)
- In features/events folder, create eventActions.js, eventConstants.js, and eventReducer.js files
- In eventConstants.js file:
  - Create constants for create event, update event, and delete event
    ```javascript
    export const CREATE_EVENT = 'CREATE_EVENT';
    export const DELETE_EVENT = 'DELETE_EVENT';
    export const UPDATE_EVENT = 'UPDATE_EVENT';
    ```
- In eventActions.js file:
  - Import the action constants: `import { CREATE_EVENT, DELETE_EVENT, UPDATE_EVENT } from './eventConstants';`
  - Write a createEvent action creator function that takes an event as an argument and returns the create action object
    ```javascript
    export function createEvent(event) {
      return {
        type: CREATE_EVENT,
        payload: event
      };
    }
    ```
  - Write an updateEvent action creator function that takes an event as an argument and returns the update action object
    ```javascript
    export function updateEvent(event) {
      return {
        type: UPDATE_EVENT,
        payload: event
      };
    }
    ```
  - Write a deleteEvent action creator function that takes an eventId as an argument and returns the delete action object
    ```javascript
    export function deleteEvent(eventId) {
      return {
        type: DELETE_EVENT,
        payload: eventId
      };
    }
    ```
- In eventReducer.js file:
  - Import the sample data: `import { sampleData } from '../../app/api/sampleData';`
  - Import the action constants: `import { CREATE_EVENT, DELETE_EVENT, UPDATE_EVENT } from './eventConstants';`
  - Create an initial state. This initialState is an object. Initialize the value of the events state property to the sampleData for now
    ```javascript
    const initialState = {
      events: sampleData
    };
    ```
  - Write an eventReducer function that updates the store state based on the given actions
    - 1st arg is the state. Assign its default value to the intialState
    - 2nd arg is the action. Destructure the type and payload properties from the action object
    - Note that the state is an object. events is a state property and it's an array of objects. Each item in the array is an event
    - Use switch statment to find the type of action, update the store state based on the action type, and return the updated state
    - Now, when updating the store state, we never want to mutate the state itself. Rather, we can use the spread operator(`...`) to create a new object or new array of the state and update that state instead
    - In this case, we return a state object and spread in the initial state using the spread operator(`return { ...state, }`). Then specify the state property we want to update, which in this case, the events state property. Note that the events state is an array of objects. So to update the events state, we use an array to spread in the intial events state followed by the thing we want to update(`events: [...state.events, payload]`)
    - The last case in the switch statement is the default case, which returns the current state
    ```javascript
    export default function eventReducer(state = initialState, { type, payload }) {
      switch (type) {
        case CREATE_EVENT:
          return {
            ...state,
            events: [...state.events, payload]
          };
        case UPDATE_EVENT:
          return {
            ...state,
            events: [
              ...state.events.filter((evt) => evt.id !== payload.id),
              payload
            ]
          };
        case DELETE_EVENT:
          return {
            ...state,
            events: [...state.events.filter((evt) => evt.id !== payload)]
          };
        default:
          return state;
      }
    }
    ```

### [3. Creating a root reducer](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/f0e0810d11998185498a1585aa56bd48b26323a8)
- Even though we can only have a single store in our application, we can have as many reducers as we like. Think of each reducer as a way to access a piece of the store state. We can combine all the reducers into a single rootReducer and pass that to the createStore() method in the configureStore() function
- In app/store folder, create a file called rootReducer.js
- In rootReducer.js file:
  - Import the combineReducers function: `import { combineReducers } from 'redux';`
  - Import the eventReducer: `import eventReducer from '../../features/events/eventReducer';`
  - Import the testReducer: `import testReducer from '../../features/sandbox/testReducer';`
  - Create a rootReducer by calling the combineReducers() function
    - The combineReducers() takes an object as an argument
    - In this object, we can assign different reducers to this object properties
    - NOTE THAT THE PROPERTY NAME WE ASSIGN TO EACH REDUCER WILL BECOME THE PROPERTY NAME IN THE STORE AND WE ACCESS A PARTICULAR STATE IN THE STORE BY CALLING THE NAME OF THE REDUCER. For example, to access the events array object in the store, we use state.event, because event is the property name we gave to the eventReducer. And the event property is a state object that has the events property
    ```javascript
    const rootReducer = combineReducers({
      test: testReducer,
      event: eventReducer
    });

    export default rootReducer;
    ```
- In configureStore.js file:
  - Import the rootReducer: `import rootReducer from './rootReducer';`
  - Pass in the rootReducer as the first argument to the createStore() method
  ```javascript
  export function configureStore() {
    return createStore(rootReducer, devToolsEnhancer());
  }
  ```

### [4. Getting events from the Redux store](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/3534c8b5f58c01a89a6d5c68696d4d286c41b963)
- Instead of getting events from the local state of a component, we can get the events from the Redux store using the useSelector() hook. useSelector() hook comes with React-Redux library
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import the useSelector() hook: `import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';`
  - Get the events property from store using the useSelector() hook
    - The useSelector() hook takes a selector function as an argument
    - The selector function is called with the store state and returns the result value based on the name of the reducer used. We get the events property from the store using state.event and event is the name of the reducer
    - Destructure the events property from the store
    - `const { events } = useSelector((state) => state.event);`
- Next, we want to populate the event information onto the event detailed page. We can get an event info from the store using the useSelector() hook. Since the EventDetailedPage component is a routed component, we can get the event id from the route params. Weuse this event id to retreive the event from the store. The event id lives inside the params property and it's inside the match props. match.params.id
- In EventDetailedPage.jsx file:
  - Destructure the match props to get access to the route params
    - `export default function EventDetailedPage({ match }) {...}`
  - Use the useSelector() hook to get an event from the store based on the event id
    ```javascript
    const event = useSelector((state) =>
      state.event.events.find((e) => e.id === match.params.id)
    );
    ```
  - Pass down the event object as event props to the EventDetailedHeader and EventDetailedInfo child components
    - `<EventDetailedHeader event={event} />`
    - `<EventDetailedInfo event={event} />`
  - Pass down the event.attendees array as attendees props to the EventDetailedSidebar child component
    - `<EventDetailedSidebar attendees={event.attendees} />`
- In both EventDetailedHeader.jsx and EventDetailedInfo.jsx files:
  - Receive the event props from the EventDetailedPage parent component and destructure it
  - In the render section, we can populate the event info dynamically based on the event id in the route params
- In EventDetailedSidebar.jsx file:
  - Receive the attendees props from the EventDetailedPage parent component and destructure it
  - Use `attendees.length` to show the total number of people attending
  - Use a ternary operator to if attendees.length is greater than 1 to whether display 'People' or 'Person'
  - `{attendees.length} {attendees.length > 1 ? 'People' : 'Person'} Going`
  - Call .map() method on attendees array to display each attendee onto the page

### [5. Dispatching event actions](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/b8c774dcce3786050a0ff25702755f233930f879)
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - Import the useDispatch hook: `import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';`
  - Import the deleteEvent action: `import { deleteEvent } from '../eventActions';`
  - Create a dispatch function using the useDispatch() hook
    - `const dispatch = useDispatch();`
  - In the 'Delete' Button element
    - When the button is clicked, execute the dispatch() method and pass in the deleteEvent() action creator as an argument to dispatch the action to the reducer. Pass in the event.id to the deleteEvent() action method
    - `onClick={() => dispatch(deleteEvent(event.id))}`
- In the EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import useSelector and useDispatch hooks: `import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';`
  - Import the createEvent and updateEvent actions: `import { updateEvent, createEvent } from '../eventActions';`
  - Destructure the match props to get access to the route params
    - `export default function EventForm({ match }) {...}`
  - Use the useSelector() hook to get an event from the store based on the event id
    ```javascript
    const selectedEvent = useSelector((state) =>
      state.event.events.find((e) => e.id === match.params.id)
    );
    ```
  - Create a dispatch function using the useDispatch() hook
    - `const dispatch = useDispatch();`
  - In the handleFormSubmit() method:
    - To update an event, call the dispatch() function and pass in the updateEvent() action creator function as an argument
    - To create an event, call the dispatch() function and pass in the createEvent() action creator function as an argument
    
### [6. Clean up code, add key to EventForm](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/bd44dbc2c724074768404256723107ad634d6f53)
- After the user submitted the form to update an event, we want to direct them to the events list page
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Add the history props to the EventForm component
    - `export default function EventForm({ match, history }) {...}`
  - In the handleFormSubmit() method, use history.push() method and pass in the pathname to redirect the user
    - `history.push('/events');`
- Another issue we have at the moment is when we redirect user to create a new event, the data is still populated in the form and doesn't clear out. The reason for this is we're not giving our component a key, because we're not unmounting the component when we redirect to a new form or manage a new event
- To ensure that we create a new instance of a component, we need to give it a key property. We want to give a key property to our EventForm component. We can do this in the App component because that is where we created the route for the EventForm component
- When we are routed to different pages in our application, the location key value gets updated in the browser's location object. Since the App component is not a routed component, it has no access to the browser's location object. We can use the useLocation() hook from react-router-dom to have access to the location object and the key property
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import the useLocation hook: `import { Route, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Create a location key using the useLocation() hook. Destructure the key property
    - `const { key } = useLocation();`
  - Specify the key property on the route that contains the EventForm component
    - `<Route path={['/createEvent', '/manage/:id']} component={EventForm} key={key} />`

### [7. Scroll to top: ScrollToTop component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/6b94b94ef8e21a2201483a6bd941bc938e90fbef)
- Currently, when we go to a different page, it doesn't automatically take us to the top of the page
- In app/layout folder, create a component/file called ScrollToTop.jsx
- In ScrollToTop.jsx file:
  - Import useEffect hook: `import { useEffect } from 'react';`
  - Import useLocation hook: `import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Get the pathname property from the browser's location object using the useLocation hook
    - `const { pathname } = useLocation();`
  - Use useEffect() hook to execute the window.scrollTo() method to scroll to the top of the window when the location pathname property changes
    ```javascript
    export default function ScrollToTop() {
      const { pathname } = useLocation();

      useEffect(() => {
        window.scrollTo(0, 0);
      }, [pathname]);

      return null;
    }
    ```
- In the index.js file:
  - Import the ScrollToTop component: `import ScrollToTop from './app/layout/ScrollToTop';`
  - Use the ScrollToTop component just above the App component: `<ScrollToTop />`


## FORMS REVISITED
- React does not provide a Form solution
- Formik is a popular forms solution for React: https://formik.org/docs/api/formik
- A Forms package helps keep track of:
  - values
  - errors
  - visited fields
  - validation
  - handling submission
- Our goal is to create reusable fields, with validation that can be used in any project

### [1. Setting up Formik](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/1712ad76651cff854a6ffc30bfcb619ea2528ad5)
- Website: https://formik.org/docs/api/formik
- Install package: `npm i formik`
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import Formik: `import Formik from 'formik';`
  - In the render section:
    - Wrap the `<Formik />` component around the entire `<Form />` element
    - In the `<Formik>` component, add the following properties
      ```javascript
			<Formik
				initialValues={initialValues}
				onSubmit={values => console.log(values)}
			>
      ```
    - Next thing we want to do is pass down the handleChange, handleSubmit, and the values themselves as props from Formik to the Form element. And the way we do that is use render props
    - Just above the Form element, render an arrow function that contains the props that we want to pass down. Also, we can destructure the props objects that we're passing down to Form element. And what this arrow function returns is everything that is inside the Form element itself
      ```javascript
			<Formik
				initialValues={initialValues}
				onSubmit={values => console.log(values)}
			>
				{({ values, handleChange, handleSubmit }) => (
					<Form> ...</Form>
			)}
			</Formik>
      ```
    - Then, inside the Form element:
      - We can swap the old handleFormSubmit method for handleSubmit coming from Formik
      - Swap the handleInputChange method for all of the input elements for handleChange

### [2. Formik with less code](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/390419cd5cc6adfb6473bc4f43918ef6cac51d87)
- We can use some Formik's helper components:
  - `<Form />`: Form is a small wrapper around an HTML `<form>` element that automatically hooks into Formik's `handleSubmit` and `handleReset`. All other props are passed directly through to the DOM node
  - `<Field />`: Field will automatically hook up inputs to Formik. It uses the `name` attribute to match up with Formik state. `<Field />` will default to an HTML `<input />` element 
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import Formik's Form and Field components. And delete the Semantic UI Form component: `import { Formik, Form, Field } from 'formik';`
  - Since we're still using Semantic UI to style our form, we can add the className to the Form element `className='ui form'`
  - For the Semantic UI `<Form.Field />` elements, we can switch it to Semantic UI `FormField` element to style the fields
    - Import: `import { FormField } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - We'll use `<Field />` from Formik for our `<input />` field elements  
  - Our event form structure using Formik:
    ```javascript
    <Formik
      initialValues={initialValues}
      onSubmit={(values) => console.log(values)}
    >
      <Form className='ui form'>
        <FormField>
          <Field name='title' placeholder='Event title' />
        </FormField>

        <FormField>
          <Field name='category' placeholder='Category' />
        </FormField>

        <FormField>
          <Field name='description' placeholder='Description' />
        </FormField>

        <FormField>
          <Field name='city' placeholder='City' />
        </FormField>

        <FormField>
          <Field name='venue' placeholder='Venue' />
        </FormField>

        <FormField>
          <Field name='date' placeholder='Event date' type='date' />
        </FormField>

        <Button type='submit' floated='right' positive content='Submit' />
        <Button
          as={Link}
          to='/events'
          type='submit'
          floated='right'
          content='Cancel'
        />
      </Form>
    </Formik>
    ```

### [3. Form validation with Formik validationSchema](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/3385736ea3a2fc55badc8c6c4027c117c8783e1f)
- Source: https://formik.org/docs/guides/validation
- Formik Validation: Formik is designed to manage forms with complex validation with ease. Formik supports synchronous and asynchronous form-level and field-level validation. Furthermore, it comes with baked-in support for schema-based form-level validation through Yup
- Install Yup: `npm i yup`
- Another Formik helper component we will use:
  - `<ErrorMessage />`: is a component that renders the error message of a given field if that field has been visited (i.e. `touched[name] === true`) (and there is an `error` message present). It expects that all error messages are stored for a given field as a string. Like `<Field />`, `<FastField />`, and `<FieldArray >`, lodash-like dot path and bracket syntax is supported
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import Yup: `import * as Yup from 'yup';`
  - Import Formik ErrorMessage component: `import { Formik, Form, Field, ErrorMessage } from 'formik';`
  - Use Yup.object() to create a validationSchema  
    ```javascript
    const validationSchema = Yup.object({
      title: Yup.string().required()
    });
    ```
  - In the `<Formik />` component, add a validationSchema property and set it to the validationSchema we've just created
    ```javascript
    <Formik
      initialValues={initialValues}
      validationSchema={validationSchema}
      onSubmit={(values) => console.log(values)}
    >
    ```

### [4. Creating a reusable text input field: MyTextInput component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/a888bfbbcf37d4e8f314fdcc04bebfacd0521966)
- DOC for useField() hook: https://formik.org/docs/api/useField 
- Let's create a reusable text input field component that has input error handling and styling. Use Semantic UI for styling and Formik Field props for error handling
- In src/app/common/form folder, create a component/file called MyTextInput.jsx
- In MyTextInput.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import useField hook from Formik: `import { useField } from 'formik';`
  - Import Semantic UI FormField component: `import { FormField } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Create a MyTextInput functional component that renders a form input field with error handling message
    - This component receives props from Formik
      - `export default function MyTextInput({ label, ...props }) {...}`
    - Use useField() hook to extract field and meta properties from Formik Field component
      - `const [field, meta] = useField(props);`
    - Render the form input field using Semantic UI
      ```javascript
      export default function MyTextInput({ label, ...props }) {
        const [field, meta] = useField(props);

        return (
          <FormField error={meta.touched && !!meta.error}>
            <label>{label}</label>
            <input {...field} {...props} />
            {meta.touched && meta.error ? (
              <Label basic color='red'>
                {meta.error}
              </Label>
            ) : null}
          </FormField>
        );
      }
      ```
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import the MyTextInput component: `import MyTextInput from '../../../app/common/form/MyTextInput';`
  - Inside the `<Form />` component, instantiate the MyTextInput component and give it a name and placeholder properties
    - `<MyTextInput name='title' placeholder='Event title' />`

### [5. Cleaning up the form](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/5a9036371750db234aabf4e15b9fe34a61d2b3a9)
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Replace the rest of the FormField input fields `<FormField><Form ... />></FormField>` with the MyTextInput component to create the input fields instead.
    - Fill in the values for name and placeholder properties for each component
    - Now our event form looks like this:
    ```javascript
    <Form className='ui form'>
      <Header sub color='teal' content='Event Details' />
      <MyTextInput name='title' placeholder='Event title' />
      <MyTextInput name='category' placeholder='Category' />
      <MyTextInput name='description' placeholder='Description' />
      <Header sub color='teal' content='Event Location Details' />
      <MyTextInput name='city' placeholder='City' />
      <MyTextInput name='venue' placeholder='Venue' />
      <MyTextInput name='date' placeholder='Event date' type='date' />

      <Button type='submit' floated='right' positive content='Submit' />
      <Button
        as={Link}
        to='/events'
        type='submit'
        floated='right'
        content='Cancel'
      />
    </Form>
    ```
  - In the validationSchema,
    - Handle the validation logic for all the other inputs as well. Make all input fields required
    ```javascript
    const validationSchema = Yup.object({
      title: Yup.string().required('You must provide a title'),
      category: Yup.string().required('You must provide a category'),
      description: Yup.string().required(),
      city: Yup.string().required(),
      venu: Yup.string().required(),
      date: Yup.string().required()
    });
    ```
  - Next, handle the form submission with Formik onSubmit event. Use the form submission handling we wrote before and paste it in here
    ```javascript
    <Formik
      initialValues={initialValues}
      validationSchema={validationSchema}
      onSubmit={(values) => {
        selectedEvent
          ? dispatch(updateEvent({ ...selectedEvent, ...values }))
          : dispatch(
              createEvent({
                ...values,
                id: cuid(),
                hostedBy: 'Bob',
                attendees: [],
                hostPhotoURL: '/assets/user.png'
              })
            );
        history.push('/events');
      }}
    >
    ```

### [6. Creating a reusable text area: MyTextArea component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/5eccfd307672ffdccf0c998a31e2073ab95da0f4)
- A textarea field gives you a larger text area than an input field does. This reusable component will have the exact same functionality as the MyTextInput component does. The only difference is instead of an `<input />` element, it uses a `<textarea />` element
- In src/app/common/form folder, create a component/file called MyTextArea.jsx
- In MyTextArea.jsx file:
  - Copy the code from MyTextInput.jsx component and change the `<input />` element to `<textarea />` element
  - `<textarea {...field} {...props} />`
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import the MyTextArea component: `import MyTextArea from '../../../app/common/form/MyTextArea';`
  - For the 'Description' input field, use the MyTextArea component instead of the MyTextInput component
    - We can specify the number of rows the textarea will display using the rows property 
    - `<MyTextArea name='description' placeholder='Description' rows={3} />`
  
### [7. Creating a reusable select input: MySelectInput component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/97994e40d36130a9882ad63dbcafbcc81df1a048)
- This component will have the same error handling functionality as the MyTextInput and MyTextArea components
- DOC for useField() hook: https://formik.org/docs/api/useField 
- In src/app/common/form folder, create a component/file called MySelectInput.jsx
- In MySelectInput.jsx file:
  - Import Semantic Select component: `import { FormField, Label, Select } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Copy and paste the code from MyTextInput component as a starter
  - Bring in the 'helpers' property from useField(props) 
  - We'll use `<Select />` form from Semantic UI
    ```javascript
    <Select
      clearable
      value={field.value || null}
      onChange={(event, data) => helpers.setValue(data.value)}
      onBlur={() => helpers.setTouched(true)}
      {...props}
    />
    ```
- In src/app/api folder, create a file called categoryOptions.js file
- In categoryOptions.js file:
  - This file contains the categoryData that the user can choose from in the category select input options in an event form when they want to create or update an event
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import the MySelectInput component: `import MySelectInput from '../../../app/common/form/MySelectInput';`
  - Import the categoryData: `import { categoryData } from '../../../app/api/categoryOptions';`
  - For the 'category' input field, swap to use the MySelectInput component instead of the MyTextInput component
    - Add the 'options' property to the component and set its value to categoryData. The categoryOptions.js file contains the select options data
    - `<MySelectInput name='category' placeholder='Category' options={categoryData} />`

### [8. Creating a reusable date input: MyDateInput component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/a760f1a6af8fd5710c6adf93862505d95954b644)
- We'll be using the React Datepicker library. It gives us a consistent datepicker across every different browsers
- Install React Datepicker library: `npm i react-datepicker`
- In src/app/common/form folder, create a component/file called MyDateInput.jsx
- In MyDateInput.jsx file:
  - Import the react DatePicker component: `import DatePicker from 'react-datepicker';`
  - Import react-datepicker css file: `import 'react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css';`
  - Import useFormikContext() hook from Formik: `import { useField, useFormikContext } from 'formik';`
  - Copy and paste the code from MySelectInput component as a starter
  - We need to extract the setFieldValue method from Formik using the useFormikContext() hook. The setFieldValue() method will help us set the value from the datepicker
    - `const { setFieldValue } = useFormikContext();`
  - Use the DatePicker component in the render section. Inside the DatePicker component, we need to provide the following:
    - Bring in all the field properties from the field props using the spread operator: `{...field}`
    - Bring in all the props as well: `{...props}`
    - The selected property which brings in the selected date
    - The onChange event property to set the date value. Use the setFieldValue() method to set the value
    ```javascript
    export default function MyDateInput({ label, ...props }) {
      const { setFieldValue } = useFormikContext();
      const [field, meta] = useField(props);

      return (
        <FormField error={meta.touched && !!meta.error}>
          <label>{label}</label>
          <DatePicker
            {...field}
            {...props}
            selected={(field.value && new Date(field.value)) || null}
            onChange={(value) => setFieldValue(field.name, value)}
          />
          {meta.touched && meta.error ? (
            <Label basic color='red'>
              {meta.error}
            </Label>
          ) : null}
        </FormField>
      );
    }
    ```
  - We also want to style the datepicker using the available react-datepicker css. Just import the css file
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import the MyDateInput component: `import MyDateInput from '../../../app/common/form/MyDateInput';`
  - For 'date' input field, use the MyDateInput component instead of the MyTextInput component. And we need to specify the following properties to the component:
    - a name property
    - a placeholderText property instead of placeholder property
    - a timeFormat property to format the time
    - a showTimeSelect property, so the user can select a time
    - a timeCaption property
    - a dateFormat property to format the date in the input when the user selects it
    ```javascript
    <MyDateInput
      name='date'
      placeholderText='Event date'
      timeFormat='HH:mm'
      showTimeSelect
      timeCaption='time'
      dateFormat='MMMM d, yyyy h:mm a'
    />
    ```
- Lastly, we want to apply styles to the datepicker so that the date input field takes up the entire width of the form. Do this in global stylesheet
- In styles.css file:
  ```javascript
  .react-datepicker-wrapper {
    width: 100%;
  }
  ```

### [9. Date-fns package: format Javascript date object into string](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/8a0516e44195b8923145ca5e53c4689bfacc889e)
- We have a little issue with our current date value. Our date value is a date object, not a string. So we need to format a Javascript date object into a string that can be displayed on a page. We will use a date package to help us format dates into strings
- The react-datepicker library is already using date-fns, but we want to install a date-fns package separately. When installing date-fns, we want to install the same version as the one in react-datepicker. Run `npm ls date-fns` to see the version that react-datepicker is using. Then install date-fns of the same version. This way, we won't run into any issues
- Install date-fns: `npm i date-fns@2.16.1`
- In EventListItem.jsx, EventDetailedHeader.jsx, and EventDetailedInfo.jsx files:
  - Import date-fns: `import { format } from 'date-fns';`
    - Replace the `{event.id}` Javascript date object with the format version
    - `{format(event.date, 'MMMM d, yyyy h:mm a')}`

### [10. Formik props: control the submit and cancel buttons in event form](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/8f1c95e18ec4a9ee293cd26b3b1b6a0202e5f281)
- In our event form, we want to disable the 'Submit' button if the user hasn't completed the form correctly. To do that, we need to look into other properties/props from Formik to pass down to our form
- We're going to pass properties down to our form from Formik via 'render' props. The way we do that is:
  - Inside the `<Formik />` component, use render props. Render props starts with curly braces and uses an arrow function
  - Inside the render curly bracket, use an arrow function and destructure the props we want from Formik as an argument. Then have the `<Form />` component render inside render props
    ```javascript
    <Formik>
      {({ props, props, props }) => (
        <Form>
          ...
        </Form>
      )}
    </Formik>
    ```
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Extract the isSubmitting, dirty, and isValid properties from Formik and pass them down to our `<Form />` via render props
  - Our `<Form />` component will render inside render props. This way our form has access to those props
    ```javascript
    {({ isSubmitting, dirty, isValid }) => (
      <Form className='ui form'>
        ...
      </Form>
    )}    
    ```
  - We want to disable the 'Submit' button if:
    - the form is loading -> isSubmitting
    - the form is not valid -> !isValid
    - the input value hasn't changed from the initial value -> !dirty
    - the form is submitting -> isSubmitting
  - In the 'Submit' Button element, specify the following properties:
    ```javascript
    <Button
      loading={isSubmitting}
      disabled={!isValid || !dirty || isSubmitting}
      type='submit'
      floated='right'
      positive
      content='Submit'
    />
    ```
  - In the 'Cancel' Button element, disable the button if the form is submitting
    ```javascript
    <Button
      disabled={isSubmitting}
      as={Link}
      to='/events'
      type='submit'
      floated='right'
      content='Cancel'
    />
    ```

### [11. Modals: create a modalReducer and ModalWrapper component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/18e5d7364bac0bf28586868c27ee7ca0a9b7dc2a)
- When a user clicks on the 'Login' or 'Register' button, we want to display a modal on the screen to allow them to enter login details or register to the application
- Semantic UI has modals that we can use
- We'll use Redux to store the state of the modal. So we'll need a modalReducer
- In src/app/common/modals folder, create a file called modalReducer.js
- In modalReducer.js file:
  - Create OPEN_MODAL and CLOSE_MODAL constants
  - Create 2 action creator functions, one for openModal and another for closeModal. Each returns the action object
  - Create an initialState and set it to null
  - Create a modalReducer function
    - 1st arg is the state. Set the default state to initialState
    - 2nd arg is the action. Destructure the type and payload properties from the action object
    - Use a switch statement to base on the type
      - In the case of OPEN_MODAL,
        - destructure modalType and modalProps that we're going to get from the payload
        - then return the modalType and modalProps inside the object
      - In the case of CLOSE_MODAL,
        - simply return null
      - Default case,
        - return state
    ```javascript
    // Constants
    const OPEN_MODAL = 'OPEN_MODAL';
    const CLOSE_MODAL = 'CLOSE_MODAL';

    // Action creator
    export function openModal(payload) {
      return {
        type: OPEN_MODAL,
        payload
      };
    }

    // Action creator
    export function closeModal() {
      return {
        type: CLOSE_MODAL
      };
    }

    // State
    const initialState = null;

    // Modal reducer
    export default function modalReducer(state = initialState, { type, payload }) {
      switch (type) {
        case OPEN_MODAL:
          const { modalType, modalProps } = payload;
          return { modalType, modalProps };
        case CLOSE_MODAL:
          return null;
        default:
          return state;
      }
    }
    ```
- In rootReducer.js file:
  - Import the modalReducer: `import modalReducer from '../common/modals/modalReducer';`
  - Add the modalReducer as modals property to the combineReducers() function. This will give us access to the modals state
    - `modals: modalReducer`
- Next, we want to create a modal wrapper around any content that we want to put inside the modal itself
- In src/app/common/modals folder, create a component/file called ModalWrapper.jsx
- In ModalWrapper.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
    import { Modal } from 'semantic-ui-react';
    import { closeModal } from './modalReducer';
    ```
  - Write a ModalWrapper functional component that renders a modal using Semantic UI
    - It receives children, size, and header props as an argument. Destructure it
    - Create a dispatch function using react-redux useDispatch() hook
    - Render the modal using Semantic UI Modal component. Specify these following  properties to the Modal component:
      - set open property to true
      - on onClose event, execute the dispatch() method to dispatch the closeModal() action creator function, which doesn't take any arguments
      - set size property to size
    - Inside the Modal component:
      - Check to see if there's a header. If there is, render the modal header inside the `<Modal.Header />`
      - Render the `{children}` inside the `<Modal.Content />` 
    ```javascript
    export default function ModalWrapper({ children, size, header }) {
      const dispatch = useDispatch();

      return (
        <Modal open={true} onClose={() => dispatch(closeModal())} size={size}>
          {header && <Modal.Header>{header}</Modal.Header>}
          <Modal.Content>{children}</Modal.Content>
        </Modal>
      );
    }
    ```

### [12. Adding a Modal Manager: ModalManager component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/aee767ef46b84f82e8dee3bdf82e7ee2972c902d)
- Now that we have a a modalReducer and a modalWrapper that we can use around any modals that we create, what we need to do is have a way to select a specific modal and display it on the page
- In src/app/common/modals folder, create a component/file called ModalManager.jsx
- In ModalManager.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import useSelector() hook: `import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';`
  - Create a ModalManager functional component that renders the modal content to be displayed inside a ModalWrapper. This component is the "`{children}`" being passed to the ModaWrapper component and rendered inside the `<ModalWrapper />` component
  - In ModalManager component:
    - Create a modalLookup object that's going to allow us to check what type of modal we want to open. Set it to an empty object for now
      - `const modalLookup = {};`
    - We also want to check what's our current modal actually is in our Redux store. We can use the useSelector() hook to find out
      - `const currentModal = useSelector((state) => state.modals);`
    - Create a renderedModal variable and not have any value for now
      - `let renderedModal;`
    - If we have a modal open, then the modalType and modalProps are going to be what stored in the currentModal state
    - Use an if statement to check if there's a currentModal in the state. If there is,
      - we can destructure the modalType and modalProps from the currentModal object. In our modalReducer, when OPEN_MODAL, we return the modalType and modalProps in an object, hence we can destructure those properties
      - create a ModalComponent from the modalLookup object with the modalType we want to display on the page
      - set the renderedModal to render a `<ModalComponent />` with the modalProps that we have available for this particular modal
      ```javascript
      if (currentModal) {
        const { modalType, modalProps } = currentModal;
        const ModalComponent = modalLookup[modalType];
        renderedModal = <ModalComponent {...modalProps} />;
      }
      ```
    - Then return the renderedModal in a span element to display the modal onto the page
    ```javascript
    export default function ModalManager() {
      const modalLookup = {};
      const currentModal = useSelector((state) => state.modals);
      let renderedModal;

      if (currentModal) {
        const { modalType, modalProps } = currentModal;
        const ModalComponent = modalLookup[modalType];
        renderedModal = <ModalComponent {...modalProps} />;
      }

      return <span>{renderedModal}</span>;
    }
    ```
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import the ModalManager component: `import ModalManager from '../common/modals/ModalManager';`
  - Instantiate the ModalManager component as the first item in the render section. This will ensure that whenever we open a modal, it's guaranteed to be visible
    - `<ModalManager />`

### [13. Creating a sign-in form: LoginForm component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/0562d383aa6d94d95affe44d1349c7fbc06950fb)
- On the NavBar, when the user clicks on the 'Login' button, a sign-in modal opens on the page and the user can provide their email and password to login. We'll create a LoginForm component which has the modal content that can be rendered inside the ModalWrapper as children. The ModalManger will look for the type of modal to be displayed. The LoginForm will have validation as well
- In src/features/auth folder, create a component/file called LoginForm.jsx
- In LoginForm.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { Formik, Form } from 'formik';
    import { Button } from 'semantic-ui-react';
    import * as Yup from 'yup';
    import ModalWrapper from '../../app/common/modals/ModalWrapper';
    import MyTextInput from '../../app/common/form/MyTextInput';
    ```
  - Write a LoginForm functional component that renders a login form using Formik
    - In the render section, instantiate the ModalWrapper component: `<ModalWrapper />`
      - Provide the size and header properties to the ModalWrapper component
      - `<ModalWrapper size='mini' header='Sign in to Re-vents'>`
    - Inside the `<ModalWrapper />` component, create the login form using `<Formik />` component
    - Provide the following properties to the Formik component:
      - initialValues property and set it to an empty-string email and password object
      - validationSchema property to validate the email and password input fields. Use the Yup library
      - onSubmit property to submit the values. Console log the values for now
      ```javascript
      <Formik
        initialValues={{ email: '', password: '' }}
        validationSchema={Yup.object({
          email: Yup.string().required().email(),
          password: Yup.string().required()
        })}
        onSubmit={values => {
          console.log(values)
        }}
      >
      ```
    - Inside the Formik tag, we'll pass down some render props to our form via render props: `{({props, props}) => (<Form> ... </Form>)}`
      - The props we want to pass are isSubmitting, isValid and dirty. Destructure them
      - Then render the `<Form />` component inside render props
    - Inside the Form tag, 
      - we'll use the MyTextInput components to render the email and password text input fields
      - also add a 'Submit' Button
      - then use the Formik props to apply validation logic to the 'Submit' button
    ```javascript
    export default function LoginForm() {
      return (
        <ModalWrapper size='mini' header='Sign in to Re-vents'>
          <Formik
            initialValues={{ email: '', password: '' }}
            validationSchema={Yup.object({
              email: Yup.string().required().email(),
              password: Yup.string().required()
            })}
            onSubmit={(values) => {
              console.log(values);
            }}
          >
            {({ isSubmitting, isValid, dirty }) => (
              <Form className='ui form'>
                <MyTextInput name='email' placeholder='Email Address' />
                <MyTextInput
                  name='password'
                  placeholder='Password'
                  type='password'
                />
                <Button
                  loading={isSubmitting}
                  disabled={!isValid || !dirty || isSubmitting}
                  type='submit'
                  fluid
                  size='large'
                  color='teal'
                  content='Login'
                />
              </Form>
            )}
          </Formik>
        </ModalWrapper>
      );
    }
    ```
- In ModalManger.jsx file:
  - We need to tell the ModalManger about the LoginForm modal
  - Import the LoginForm component: `import LoginForm from '../../../features/auth/LoginForm';`
  - Then pass in the LoginForm component to the modalLookup object
    - `const modalLookup = { TestModal, LoginForm };`
- In SignedOutMenu.jsx file:
  - When the 'Login' button is clicked, a login form modal opens
  - Import useDispatch() hook: `import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';`
  - Import openModel action creator method: `import { openModal } from '../../app/common/modals/modalReducer';`
  - Create a dispatch method using the useDispatch() hook
    - `const dispatch = useDispatch();`
  - In the 'Login' Button:
    - When the button is clicked, execute the dispatch() method and pass in the openModal() method
    - The openModal() method takes an object as argument. And inside the object, we can provide a modalType property with the value of 'LoginForm', which is the LoginForm component
    ```javascript
    <Button
      onClick={() => dispatch(openModal({ modalType: 'LoginForm' }))}
      basic
      inverted
      content='Login'
    />
    ```

### [14. Adding an authReducer](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/250581fa2cdff71e18de156d2856b7fe4a20eb17)
- Let's create an authReducer so we can store our authentication state in Redux store
- In src/features/auth folder, create authConstants.js, authActions.js, and authReducer.js files
- In authConstants.js file:
  - Create constants for SIGN_IN_USER and SIGN_OUT_USER
  ```javascript
  export const SIGN_IN_USER = 'SIGN_IN_USER';
  export const SIGN_OUT_USER = 'SIGN_OUT_USER';
  ```
- In authActions.js file:
  - Import action constants: `import { SIGN_IN_USER, SIGN_OUT_USER } from './authConstants';`
  - Write a signInUser action creator function that returns the action object
    - This function takes payload as an argument
    ```javascript
    export function signInUser(payload) {
      return {
        type: SIGN_IN_USER,
        payload
      };
    }
    ```
  - Write a signOutUser action creator function that returns the action object
    - This function doesn't take any arguments
    ```javascript
    export function signOutUser() {
      return {
        type: SIGN_OUT_USER
      };
    }
    ```
- In authReducer.js file:
  - Import the constants: `mport { SIGN_IN_USER, SIGN_OUT_USER } from './authConstants';`
  - Create an initialState object
    ```javascript
    const initialState = {
      authenticated: false,
      currentUser: null
    };
    ```
  - Write an authReducer function that updates the state in the store based on the action type
    - 1st arg is the state. Set the default state to initialState object
    - 2nd arg is the action. Destructure the type and payload properties from the action object
    - Use a switch statement to base on the type
      - In the case of SIGN_IN_USER, we want to return an object with
        - the original state
        - set the authenticated property to true
        - set the currentUser property to an object which contains the user's email and photoURL. The email value comes from the payload props and set the photoURL to a static image for now
      - In the case of SIGN_OUT_USER, we want to return an object with
        - the original state
        - set authenticated to false
        - set currentUser to null
      - Default case,
        - return state
    ```javascript
    export default function authReducer(state = initialState, { type, payload }) {
      switch (type) {
        case SIGN_IN_USER:
          return {
            ...state,
            authenticated: true,
            currentUser: {
              email: payload.email,
              photoURL: '/assets/user.png'
            }
          };
        case SIGN_OUT_USER:
          return {
            ...state,
            authenticated: false,
            currentUser: null
          };
        default:
          return state;
      }
    }
    ```
- In rootReducer.js file:
  - Import the authReducer: `import authReducer from '../../features/auth/authReducer';`
  - Add the authReducer as auth property to the combineReducers() function. This will give us access to the auth state
    - `auth: authReducer`

### [15. Hooking up the LoginForm](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/bce868ff3d43900a656b6d1667a0ed5a31d58017)
- When we submit the LoginForm, we want to dispatch the signInUser() action with the login data. We also want to close the modal after we submitted
- In LoginForm.jsx file:
  - Import the useDispatch() hook: `import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';`
  - Import signInUser action: `import { signInUser } from './authActions';`
  - Import closeModal action: `import { closeModal } from '../../app/common/modals/modalReducer';`
  - Create a dispatch method using the useDispatch() hook
    - `const dispatch = useDispatch();`
  - One problem we have is when the 'Submit' button is clicked, the loading spinner never stops. The way Formik works is when we submit, the submitting status is always set to true and after our action is completed, it's up to us to set the submitting status back to false. What we can do is destructure the setSubmitting property from Formik and use it to set the submitting status manually to false after we've submitted our values
  - On onSubmit event property:
    - Use an arrow function to handle submit
    - The function takes 2 arguments. 1st arg is the values we provide. 2nd arg is the setSubmitting property we destructure from Formik 
    - Inside the callback, execute the dispatch() method pass in the signInUser() action and provide it the values
    - Then call the setSubmitting() method to set the submitting status to false
    - Then call another dispatch() method to close the modal using the closeModel() action
    ```javascript
    onSubmit={(values, { setSubmitting }) => {
      dispatch(signInUser(values));
      setSubmitting(false);
      dispatch(closeModal());
    }}
    ```
- In our NavBar component, instead of using the local state to check if a user is authenticated, we can now use our Redux store to see if they're authenticated or not
- In NavBar.jsx file:
  - Import the useSelector() hook: `import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';`
  - Get the authenticated state from the Redux store using the useSelector() hook. Destructure the authenticated property from the auth state object
    - `const { authenticated } = useSelector((state) => state.auth);`
  - The authenticated state is either true or false. So in the NavBar, if the user is authenticated, they can see the 'Create Event' button and the `<SignedInMenu />` component is rendered
- In the SignedInMenu component, when the user clicks 'Sign out' we can dispatch the signOutUser() action and redirect them to homepage. Also, once they're successfully signed in, we want to display the currentUser info from our Redux store
- In SignedInMenu.jsx file:
  - Import useSelector() and useDispatch() hooks: `import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';`
  - Import useHistory() hook: `import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Import signOutUser action: `import { signOutUser } from './authActions';`
  - Creat a dispatch method using the useDispatch() hook
    - `const dispatch = useDispatch();`
  - Get the browser history object using the useHistory() hook
    - `const history = useHistory();`
  - When the 'Sign out' dropdown item is clicked, we want to do two things. Call the signOutUser() action to signout the user and redirect user to home page
    - On the onClick event, use an arrow function to execute the dispatch() method and call the signOutUser() action
    - Then use the history.push() method to direct use to homepage
    ```javascript
    <Dropdown.Item
      onClick={() => {
        dispatch(signOutUser());
        history.push('/');
      }}
      text='Sign out'
      icon='power'
    />
    ```
  - We also want to get the currentUser property from the auth state. Once the user is logged-in, we can populate their info
    - `const { currentUser } = useSelector((state) => state.auth);`
  - For the user profile image, set the image source to `currentUser.photoURL` or the default user static image
    - `src={currentUser.photoURL || '/assets/user.png'}`
  - For the user's name, set it to their email
    - `<Dropdown pointing='top left' text={currentUser.email}>`


## GOOGLE MAPS INTEGRATION
- Places Autocomplete
  - Provides dropdown and lookup for locations
  - Can provide different levels: countries, cities, businesses, etc
- Google Maps Integration
  - Provides a map of an area with given co-ordinations
  Takes a Lat/Lng

### [1. Enable Google Maps APIs and generate API key](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/d49e7d442a8c6acf4d4c3577be1189e173a4c73b)
- Go to Google Developer Console site and login with Google account
  - https://console.developers.google.com/
- Click on the 'New Project' button to create a new project. Name the project
- In the APIs & Services menu, select Library. In the search bar, find these 3 APIs and enable them
  - Maps Javascript API
  - Geocoding API
  - Places API
- We need to manually set the requests limit for all of these API services, so that we won't get charged no matter what. We are required to provide billing info to use Google Maps. In the IAM & Admin menu, select Quotas:
  - In the Quotas section, there's a dropdown menu that will have the 3 APIs
  - Go into each one and set the requests limit to 100
- In the APIs & Services menu, select Credentials
  - Click the '+ CREATE CREDENTIALS' button at the top. This will generate the API key

### [2. Setting up places autocomplete](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/d49e7d442a8c6acf4d4c3577be1189e173a4c73b)
- Source: https://github.com/hibiken/react-places-autocomplete
- Install: `npm i react-places-autocomplete`
- Add this script to index.html file and replace the api key you get from Google APIs for this project
  - `<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=places"></script>`
- Later on when we deploy the project, we will restrict the API key to our project site only
- **Testing out Google Places:**
- In sandbox folder, create a component/file called TestPlaceInput.jsx
- In TestPlaceInput.jsx file, copy and paste the demo code from the above github website. Then make the following changes:
  - Change from class component to functional component
  - Delete the constructor and add address state using useState() hook:
    - `const [address, setAddress] = useState('');`
  - Change the arrow event handler functions to regular functions
  - Remove all 'this' keyword
  - In the handleSelect() function, call setAddress method to set the address as the last thing. So when a place is selected from the auto-suggest list, the selected place will show up in the input field
- In Sandbox.jsx file:
  - Import the TestPlaceInput component
  - Instantiate the component in the render section: `<div><TestPlaceInput /></div>`
- When typing in the input field, it should give an auto-suggest list of places. And when a place is selected, that selected place will show up in the input field. The lat/long of the place will print in the console

### [3. Creating a custom place input: MyPlaceInput component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/2fb8d7f61296edf33b68c1f5e8236906b8e1cd9d)
- The react-places-autocomplete library gives us:
  - A PlacesAutocomplete componenent
  - geocodeByAddress() method:
    - It takes an address as an argument
    - It's an async operation and what we get back is either a results or an error. The results is an array
    - We can then use the first element of this results array and pass it to the getLatLng() method 
  - getLatLng() method:
    - It takes the results from geocodeByAddress() method as an argument
    - This is an async operation and what we get back is either the latLng of the place or an error
- In our project, when a user selects a place for venue and city input fields, we want to store, as an object, the text of the address and the lat/lng object so we can use those coordinates to display a map later on
- The `<PlacesAutocomplete />` component needs the following:
  - the value property set to address state
  - the onChange property set to on change event handler (handleChange function)
  - the onSelect property set to on select event handler (handleSelect function)
- The following props we get from the PlacesAutocomplete component via render props:
  - getInputProps() method
  - suggestions - it's an array of suggestions
  - getSuggestionItemProps() method
  - loading
- In src/app/common/form folder, create a component/file called MyPlaceInput.jsx
- In MyPlaceInput.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import PlacesAutocomplete, { geocodeByAddress, getLatLng } from 'react-places-autocomplete';
    import { useField } from 'formik';
    import { FormField, Label, List, Segment } from 'semantic-ui-react';
    ```
  - Write a MyPlaceInput functional component that renders a place autocomplete input field using Formik and Semantic UI
    - This component receives these props: label, options, ...props
    - Use useField() hook to extract field, meta, and helpers properties from Formik Field component
      - `const [field, meta, helpers] = useField(props);`
    - Write a handleSelect function handler that executes the geocodeByAddress() method 
      - The geocodeByAddress() method takes an address as an argument
      - The method takes the address and returns the latLng coordinates
      - It then sets the address and latLng properties as an object in the Redux store using the helpers.setValue() method
      - This is an async operation and we'll either get the results and the latLng coordinates or an error. Use .then() and .catch() methods to handle both
      ```javascript
      function handleSelect(address) {
        geocodeByAddress(address)
          .then((results) => getLatLng(results[0]))
          .then((latLng) => helpers.setValue({ address, latLng }))
          .catch((error) => helpers.setError(error));
      }
      ```
    - Instantiate the `<PlacesAutocomplete />` component
      - Provide the value and event handlers it needs
      - Use render props to extract the props
      - Render the input field inside the `<FormField />` component and apply validation logic
      - Check to see if there's any suggestions in the suggestions array. If there is, map over the array and display each suggestion in a List using Semantic UI
    ```javascript
    export default function MyPlaceInput({ label, options, ...props }) {
      const [field, meta, helpers] = useField(props);

      function handleSelect(address) {
        geocodeByAddress(address)
          .then((results) => getLatLng(results[0]))
          .then((latLng) => helpers.setValue({ address, latLng }))
          .catch((error) => helpers.setError(error));
      }

      return (
        <PlacesAutocomplete
          value={field.value['address']}
          onChange={(value) => helpers.setValue({ address: value })}
          onSelect={(value) => handleSelect(value)}
          searchOptions={options}
        >
          {({ getInputProps, suggestions, getSuggestionItemProps, loading }) => (
            <FormField error={meta.touched && !!meta.error}>
              <input {...getInputProps({name: field.name, ...props})} />
              {meta.touched && meta.error ? (
                <Label basic color='red'>
                  {meta.error}
                </Label>
              ) : null}
              {suggestions?.length > 0 && (
                <Segment loading={loading} style={{ marginTop: 0, position: 'absolute', zIndex: 1000, width: '100%' }}>
                  <List selection>
                    {suggestions.map(suggestion => (
                      <List.Item {...getSuggestionItemProps(suggestion)} key={suggestion.placeId}>
                        <List.Header>
                          {suggestion.formattedSuggestion.mainText}
                        </List.Header>
                        <List.Description>
                          {suggestion.formattedSuggestion.secondaryText}
                        </List.Description>
                      </List.Item>
                    ))}
                  </List>
                </Segment>
              )}
            </FormField>
          )}
        </PlacesAutocomplete>
      );
    }
    ```

### [4. Using the place input: MyPlaceInput component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/8814420cf7d1c2cd3b11f725769a355fb4ce2603)
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import the MyPlaceInput component: `import MyPlaceInput from '../../../app/common/form/MyPlaceInput';`
  - For 'City' and 'Venue' input fields, use `<MyPlaceInput />` component
- In the const initialValues object, We need to set the initial values for the city and venue properties as objects, not strings. Because in the PlacesAutocomplete component, we call setValue() to set the value state with an object that has the address and latLng properties in it
  ```javascript
	const initialValues = selectedEvent ?? {
		title: '',
		category: '',
		description: '',
		city: {
			address: '',
			latLng: null
		},
		venue: {
			address: '',
			latLng: null
		},
		date: ''
	};
  ```
- Because we've changed the values for city and venue fields/properties into objects, we need to update this change in our validationSchema as well. We need to validate with a Yup.object() instead of Yup.string()
  ```javascript
  city: Yup.object().shape({
    address: Yup.string().required('City is required')
  }),
  venue: Yup.object().shape({
    address: Yup.string().required('Venue is required')
  }),
  ```
- In MyPlaceInput.jsx file:
  - When we're handling the FormField validation error, the error is no longer a string. It's going to an object error that has the properties for the address and latLng. So when there's a field error, we want to specify that we want the address error out of the error object by using the bracket[] notation
    ```javascript
    {meta.touched && meta.error ? (
      <Label basic color='red'>
        {meta.error['address']}
      </Label>
    ) : null}
    ```
  - Another issue we're having is when a user starts typing in the field and leaves the field, we want to make sure that we have the latLng coordinates value. We need to check on the field.onBlur event, which recognizes if someone has touched the field and moved out of it. We want to write an event handler to handle the onBlur event
    - Check if there's no value in the field.value.latLng. If there isn't, reset the city object property to be empty again
    ```javascript
    function handleBlur(e) {
      field.onBlur(e);
      if (!field.value.latLng) {
        helpers.setValue({ address: '', latLng: null });
      }
    }
    ```
  - Then on the onBlur event in the input element, call the handleBlur function in an arrow function
    ```javascript
    <input
      {...getInputProps({
        name: field.name,
        onBlur: (e) => handleBlur(e),
        ...props
      })}
    />
    ```

### [5. Narrowing the place input search results: EventForm](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/bd90e4e056200eb9569674d1b20d26c156e9f917)
- What we want to do next is when we select a specific city, we want to see venues that are located in that area
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - In render props, pass down the values props to our form
    - `{({ isSubmitting, dirty, isValid, values }) => ( ... )}`
  - In the 'venue' `<MyPlaceInput />` component, we need to pass two additional properties to the component:
    - the disabled property. We want to disable the venue input field if there's no city latLng value
    - the options property. We want to narrow down the venue results based on the type, radius, and location of a latLng/city
    - add this at the top of the file, because our component doesn't know about the google maps script in index.html file
      - `/* global google */`
    ```javascript
    <MyPlaceInput
      name='venue'
      placeholder='Venue'
      disabled={!values.city.latLng}
      options={{
        location: new google.maps.LatLng(values.city.latLng),
        radius: 1000,
        types: ['establishment']
      }}
    />
    ```

### [6. google-map-react library: display google maps onto a page](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/dc90a8cbd55afb432479dc46a601dc632ae099f1)
- Source: https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-map-react
- Install: `npm i google-map-react`
- Display a Google map based on the given city's latLng coordinates. We'll use the google-map-react library to display the map. We'll first test out the Google maps in sandbox to display a map based on the city's latLng coordinates that the user typed in the 'Search Places' input field
- **Testing Google maps in Sandbox**
- In Sandbox.jsx file:
  - We need to create a location state in the Sandbox component
    - Then we can pass down the setLocation method as props to the TestPlaceInput child component to get the city's latLng and store it in the location state
    - Once we have the latLng in the state, we can pass down the location state as props to the TestMap component to display a map based on the location latLng
  - Create an initial location state object
    ```javascript
    const defaultProps = {
      center: {
        lat: 59.95,
        lng: 30.33
      },
      zoom: 11
    };
    ```
  - Create location state using useState() hook and set the initial value to defaultProps. Location state is an object
    - `const [location, setLocation] = useState(defaultProps);`
  - Write a handleSetLocation function that sets the center property to be the lat/lng coordinates
    ```javascript
    function handleSetLocation(latLng) {
      setLocation({ ...location, center: { lat: latLng.lat, lng: latLng.lng } });
    }
    ```
  - Pass down the handleSetLocation method as setLocation props to the TestPlaceInput child component
    - `<TestPlaceInput setLocation={handleSetLocation} />`
  - Pass down the location state as location props to the TestMap child component
    - `<TestMap location={location} />`
- In TestPlaceInput.jsx file:
  - Receive the setLocation method props from Sandbox parent component
  - When calling the getLatLng() method and the latLng result comes back, call the setLocation() method to set the location state to latLng. Now the location state has the latLng coordinates
    ```javascript
    .then((results) => getLatLng(results[0]))
    .then((latLng) => {
      console.log('Success', latLng)
      setLocation(latLng)
    })
    ```
- In sandbox folder, create a component/file called TestMap.jsx
- In TestMap.jsx file:
  - Copy and paste the example code from the npm google-map-react website. Switch to using a functional component instead of a class component
  - Receive the location state props from Sandbox parent component
  - In the `<GoogleMapReact />` component:
    - Provide the google map api key and pass in as an object
    - Set the center and zoom properties to location.center and location.zoom
    - In the `<AnyReactComponent />` component, provide the lat/lng coordinates
  ```javascript
  import React from 'react';
  import GoogleMapReact from 'google-map-react';

  const AnyReactComponent = ({ text }) => <div>{text}</div>;

  export default function TestMap({ location }) {
    return (
      // Important! Always set the container height explicitly
      <div style={{ height: '100vh', width: '100%' }}>
        <GoogleMapReact
          bootstrapURLKeys={{ key: 'GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY' }}
          center={location.center}
          zoom={location.zoom}
        >
          <AnyReactComponent
            lat={location.center.lat}
            lng={location.center.lng}
            text='My Marker'
          />
        </GoogleMapReact>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

### [7. Adding the map to the EventDetailedPage: EventDetailedMap component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/2a678333f0ac0b4e900dc63fbdd6cdbb7123bf2e)
  - On the EventDetailedPage, when we click on the 'Show Map' button, we get to see a map of where the event is taking place
  - In src/features/events/eventDetailed folder, create a component/file called EventDetailedMap.jsx
  - In EventDetailedMap.jsx file:
    - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
    - Import googleMapReact component: `import GoogleMapReact from 'google-map-react';`
    - Import Semantic UI components: `import { Icon, Segment } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
    - Write a EventDetailedMap functional component to display a map of where the event takes place
      - This component receives (event venue) latLng props from the EventDetailedInfo parent component
      - Instantiate the `<GoogleMapReact />` component and specify the bootstrapURLKeys, center, and zoom properties
    - Write a Marker functional component to display a marker icon using Semantic UI
    - Use the `<Marker />` component inside the `<GoogleMapReact />` component and pass down the lat and lng props. This will display the marker on the map
    ```javascript
    function Marker() {
      return <Icon name='marker' size='big' color='red' />;
    }

    export default function EventDetailedMap({ latLng }) {
      const zoom = 14;
      return (
        <Segment attached='bottom' style={{ padding: 0 }}>
          <div style={{ height: 300, width: '100%' }}>
            <GoogleMapReact
              bootstrapURLKeys={{ key: 'GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY' }}
              center={latLng}
              zoom={zoom}
            >
              <Marker lat={latLng.lat} lng={latLng.lng} />
            </GoogleMapReact>
          </div>
        </Segment>
      );
    }
    ```
- In EventDetailedInfo.jsx file:
  - Import the EventDetailedMap component: `import EventDetailedMap from './EventDetailedMap';`
  - The last item inside the `<Segment.Group>` component, use the EventDetailedMap component and pass down the latLng props
    - `<EventDetailedMap latLng={event.venue.latLng} />`
  - Next, we only want to show the map on the EventDetailedPage when the 'Show Map' is clicked. So we need to create local state to control whether the map is being open
  - Create a mapOpen state using useState() hook and set the initial value to false
    - `const [mapOpen, setMapOpen] = useState(false);`
  - For the 'Show Map' Button element, we want to toggle the 'Show Map' and 'Hide Map' button depending on the mapOpen state
    - On onClick event, switch the mapOpen state using the setMapyOpenToggle() method
    - Then for the Button content, if mapOpen state is true, show 'Hide Map'. If mapOpen is false, show 'Show Map'
    ```javascript
    <Button
      onClick={() => setMapOpenToggle(!mapOpen)}
      color='teal'
      size='tiny'
      content={mapOpen ? 'Hide Map' : 'Show Map'}
    />
    ```
  - Then in the render section, write a condition to only show the map if mapOpen state is true
    - `{mapOpen && <EventDetailedMap latLng={event.venue.latLng} />}`


## ASYNCHRONOUS CODE

**Redux Thunk**
- A thunk is a function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation
- Allows Action Creators to return a function instead of a plain object
- Receives the store's dispatch method which is used to dispatch regular synchronous action when the async operations have completed
- Acts as middleware that we add to our store. This middleware allows us to use the store's dispatch function inside our Action Creators

**Async/Await**
- ES2017 feature
- Built on top of promises - cannot be used with plain callbacks
- Cleaner code

**Install Redux Thunk**
- Install: `npm i redux-thunk`

### [1. Set up Redux Thunk and create an asyncReducer](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/c3074a233f82451597a21dd400815662e3231352)
- In configureStore.js file:
  - The createStore() method takes 3 params: a reducer, a preloadedState, and an enhancer
  - The only store enhancer that ships with Redux is applyMiddleware(). The middleware that we're going to apply is the Redux thunk, but we've also got a devToolEnhancer(). So in order to use both of the devToolEnhancer() and Redux thunk, we're going to bring in the composeWithDevTools() method from redux-devtools-extension. The composeWithDevTools() is already come with the devToolEnhancer()
    - `import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';`
  - Import Redux thunk: `import thunk from 'redux-thunk';`
  - Also import the applyMiddleware method: `import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';`
  - In the createStore() method, we're going to pass in the composeWithDevTools() method as a 2nd param. Then call the applyMiddleware() method and pass in thunk
    - `return createStore(rootReducer, composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(thunk)));`
  - Now we have both the devToolEnhancer() and applyMiddleware(thunk) enhancers
- Next is we want to create a reducer for async functions. This particular reducer is going to control the loading state of what's going on in our application
- In src/app/async folder, create a file called asyncReducer.js
- In asyncReducer.js file:
  - We'll create the async constants, action creators, and reducer in one file
  ```javascript
  // Constants
  const ASYNC_ACTION_START = 'ASYNC_ACTION_START';
  const ASYNC_ACTION_FINISH = 'ASYNC_ACTION_FINISH';
  const ASYNC_ACTION_ERROR = 'ASYNC_ACTION_ERROR';

  // Action creator
  export function asyncActionStart() {
    return {
      type: ASYNC_ACTION_START
    };
  }

  // Action creator
  export function asyncActionFinish() {
    return {
      type: ASYNC_ACTION_FINISH
    };
  }

  // Action creator
  export function asyncActionERROR(error) {
    return {
      type: ASYNC_ACTION_ERROR,
      payload: error
    };
  }

  // Initial state
  const initialState = {
    loading: false,
    error: null
  };

  // Async reducer
  export default function asyncReducer(state = initialState, { type, payload }) {
    switch (type) {
      case ASYNC_ACTION_START:
        return {
          ...state,
          loading: true,
          error: null
        };
      case ASYNC_ACTION_FINISH:
        return {
          ...state,
          loading: false
        };
      case ASYNC_ACTION_ERROR:
        return {
          ...state,
          loading: false,
          error: payload
        };
      default:
        return state;
    }
  }
  ```
- In rootReducer.js file:
  - Import the asyncReducer: `import asyncReducer from '../async/asyncReducer';`
  - Add the asyncReducer to the combineReducers() method as the value for async property: `async: asyncReducer`

### [2. Using asynchronous functions in action creator functions](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/864047803975e60dd8e86d5a5aa4cfc60bc96704)
- In src/app/common/util folder, create a file called util.js. Any functions that don't belong anywhere else that we can apply anywhere in our application go in this file
- In util.js file:
  - Write a delay function that delays for a certain amount of time in ms millisecond
    - In order for something to be able to wait for when this particular function finishes, what we need do is return a new Promise()
    - The promise returns a resolve or a reject
    - In this case, we're going to resolve and we're going to call the setTimeout() function, which allows us to add a delay
    - In the setTimeout() function, we pass in the resolve and the ms millisecond that we get from the delay function as arguments
    ```javascript
    export function delay(ms) {
      return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
    }
    ```
- In testReducer.js file:
  - When we installed Redux thunk, it allows us to return a function inside another function. In our action creator function, we can return an asynchronous function
  - This async function can take, as a parameter, a dispatch that we get from our store. This will allow us to dispatch additional actions inside our function
  - Import the async actions: `import { asyncActionStart, asyncActionError, asyncActionFinish } from '../../app/async/asyncReducer';`
  - Import the delay function: `import { delay } from '../../app/common/util/util';`
  - Inside the increment action creator function:
    - We can return an asynchronous function. This will allow us to dispatch multiple actions inside the increment function
    - This async function takes a dispatch as an argument. It is a dispatch() method coming from react-redux to dispatch actions
    - Then in this async function,
      - dispatch the asyncActionStart() action
      - since we're using an async function, use the 'await' keyword and call the delay() function to delay the request for 2 seconds
      - after that, we want to dispatch anothat action with the type of INCREMENT_COUNTER and the payload is the amount
      - lastly, dispatch the asyncActionFinish() action
      - note that we want to call the delay() function and dispatch the INCREMENT_COUNTER and asyncActionFinish() actions inside a try/catch block. This way, if there's any problem with this asynchronous action, it's going to be caught by whatever is inside the catch block
      - if we do have an error inside the catch block,  we dispatch the asyncActionError() action and pass in the error received by the catch block. This way we can store the error inside the asyncReducer for the store and we can do whatever we want with that error in the future
    ```javascript
    export function increment(amount) {
      return async function (dispatch) {
        dispatch(asyncActionStart());
        try {
          await delay(2000);
          dispatch({ type: INCREMENT_COUNTER, payload: amount });
          dispatch(asyncActionFinish());
        } catch (error) {
          dispatch(asyncActionError(error));
        }
      };
    }
    ```
  - Do the same thing for the decrement action creator function
  - So now when the 'Increment' or 'Decrement' button is clicked, it'll delay for the amount of time set, before it will increment or decement the counter
- We can use the loading state to display a loading indicator to the user that something is happening
- In Sandbox.jsx file:
  - Extract and destructure the loading state property from the async reducer using the useSelector() hook
    - `const { loading } = useSelector((state) => state.async);`
  - Then in the 'Increment' Button element, specify the loading property and set its value to the loading state. Do the same thing for the 'Decrement' Button
    ```javascript
    <Button
      loading={loading}
      onClick={() => dispatch(increment(10))}
      content='Increment'
      color='green'
    />
    ```

### [3. Isolating the loading indicators: counter sandbox](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/753f6876385268a2a25a2f16c9bfec3e29d30b26)
- Right now both of the increment and decrement button loading indicators are loading when one button is clicked. So first we need to identify which button is actually clicked. We can specify a name property for each button. We can then get this name on the onClick event handler by calling event.target.name
- Sandbox.jsx file:
  - Create a target local state using the useState() hook and initialize its value to null
    - `const [target, setTarget] = useState(null);`
  - Inside each of the increment and decrement Button element:
    - Specify the button name property and set the value to 'increment'
    - On the onClick event handler, dispatch the increment action and also set the target state to e.target.name inside the arrow function
    - So when we click the button, we're setting the target state to the name of the button
    - Then we can use the target state to control the loading indicator. We show the loading indicator only if the target state is equal to the button name
    ```javascript
    <Button
      name='increment'
      loading={loading && target === 'increment'}
      onClick={(e) => {
        dispatch(increment(10));
        setTarget(e.target.name);
      }}
      content='Increment'
      color='green'
    />
    ```

### [4. Adding toast notifications: react-toastify library](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/dcf3406454a41e3579bede5c4e7c7c2b93fc3520)
- Let's add the ability to notify the user when there's a problem. We'll use a toast notification library called react-toastify
- Install: `npm i react-toastify`
- Toasts, like modals, they need to appear anywhere in our application. For that, we use toasts at the top of the application inside the App.jsx file
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import the react-toastify ToastContainer component: `import { ToastContainer } from 'react-toastify';`
  - Instantiate the `<ToastContainer />` component right after the `<ModalManager />` component
    - Specify the position property and set it to 'bottom-right'
    - Add the hideProgressBar property. This will hide the progress bar when toast notification pops up
    - `<ToastContainer position='bottom-right' hideProgressBar />`
- In index.js file:
  - Import the react-toastify css stylesheet right after the Semantic UI stylesheet
    - `import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.min.css';`
  - Note: the order of these stylesheets is important
- In testReducer.js file:
  - Import toast: `import { toast } from 'react-toastify';`
  - In the catch block, call the toast.error() method and pass in the error received from the catch block
    - `toast.error(error)`

### [5. Adding a mock API](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/97e14aac08ddc2c1ac668f72e66bddab774fef19)
- Instead of displaying a static events coming from a sampleData file on the EventDashboard page, we can write a fetch-events asynchronous action to fetch the events and store it in the Redux store and then display the events coming from the store. Later on we can fetch the data from a database, like Firestore, and display it on the page
- In src/app/api folder, create a file called mockApi.js
- In mockApi.js file:
  - Import the delay util function: `import { delay } from '../common/util/util';`
  - Import sampleData file: `import { sampleData } from '../api/sampleData';`
  - Write a fetchSampleData function that delays for 1 second and then returns the sampleData
    ```javascript
    export function fetchSampleData() {
      return delay(1000).then(function () {
        return Promise.resolve(sampleData);
      });
    }
    ```
- **Asynchronous action creator function structure:**
  ```javascript
  export function loadEvents() {
    return async function(dispatch) {
      try {

      } catch (error) {

      }
    }
  }
  ```
- We're going to create a fetch-event action that loads events
- In eventConstants.js file:
  - Add a fetch event constant
    - `export const FETCH_EVENTS = 'FETCH_EVENTS';`
- In eventActions.js file:
  - Import the fetch-event constant: `import { FETCH_EVENTS } from './eventConstants';`
  - Import the async actions: `import { asyncActionError, asyncActionFinish, asyncActionStart } from '../../app/async/asyncReducer';`
  - Import the fetchSampleData function: `import { fetchSampleData } from '../../app/api/mockApi';`
  - Write a loadEvents function that fetches the events from sampleData and dispatches the FETCH_EVENTS action asychronously
    - This function returns an async function
    - The async function takes a dispatch as an argument. It is a dispatch() method coming from react-redux to dispatch actions
    - It first dispatches the asyncActonStart() action
    - Then in the try/catch block:
      - It calls the fetchSampleData() method to get the data from sampleData file and assigns the data to the events variable. The 'await' keyword is in front of this method because it will wait for this method to complete and have the data returned before moving forward. If this operation fails, it will not move on and will throw an error and the catch block will catch it
      - Once the data is stored in the events variable, the function dispatches the FETCH_EVENTS action with the payload of the events. The eventReducer will look for this FETCH_EVENTS action and will store the events in the Redux store
      - Then it dispatches the asyncActionFinish() action
      - If there's a problem occurred in this process, the catch block will catch the error and the asyncActionError() action is dispatched to received this error
    ```javascript
    export function loadEvents() {
      return async function (dispatch) {
        dispatch(asyncActionStart());
        try {
          const events = await fetchSampleData();
          dispatch({ type: FETCH_EVENTS, payload: events });
          dispatch(asyncActionFinish());
        } catch (error) {
          dispatch(asyncActionError(error));
        }
      };
    }
    ```
- In eventReducer.js file:
  - Import the FETCH_EVENTS constant: `import { FETCH_EVENTS } from './eventConstants';`
  - For the initialState, set the events property to an empty array instead. We no longer need the sampleData
    ```javascript
    const initialState = {
      events: []
    };
    ```
  - Inside the eventReducer function:
    - Add a case for FETCH_EVENTS action
    - It returns as an object, the original state and the events property that is set to payload. Payload contains the events array because the loadEvents() event action function was invoked and triggered the fetchSampleData() method
      ```javascript
      case FETCH_EVENTS:
        return {
          ...state,
          events: payload
        };
      ```
- In index.js file:
  - Import the loadEvents() action: `import { loadEvents } from './features/events/eventActions';`
  - This file contains the store variable
  - To load events from the store onto the EventDashboard page, we can call the loadEvents() action using the store.dispatch() method
    - `store.dispatch(loadEvents());`
  - Notice that this is an asynchronous action and there's a slight delay before the events load onto the page

### [6. Adding a LoadingComponent](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/10f0b51782a7d97b3f50cb349f78ce9d85d00acd)
- In src/app/layout folder, create a component/file called LoadingComponent.jsx
- In LoadingComponent.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic components: `import { Dimmer, Loader } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write a LoadingComponent functional component that renders a Loader using Semantic UI
    - This component takes some default-value properties
    - The Dimmer Semantic component dims the background page while it is loading
    ```javascript
    export default function LoadingComponent({ inverted = true, content = 'Loading...' }) {
      return (
        <Dimmer inverted={inverted} active={true}>
          <Loader content={content} />
        </Dimmer>
      )
    }
    ```
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import the LoadingComponent component: `import LoadingComponent from '../../../app/layout/LoadingComponent';`
  - What we want to do is find out if we're loading. We can find that out from our asyncReducer using the useSelector() hook. Destructure the loading property
    - `const { loading } = useSelector((state) => state.async);`
  - Then check if we're loading. If we are, we want to return the `<LoadingComponent />` component
    - `if (loading) return <LoadingComponent />;`
  - If we are not, then we want to return the JSX

### [7. Using the Semantic Placeholder component to improve the UI](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/e700c0ec7078e008e9fc90aeb5bf1dad8aec881b)
- Instead of having a loading indictor taking up the entire page while we are waiting for the content to load, we can indicate the loading using a Semantic UI Placeholder component. A placeholder is used to reserve space for content that soon will appear in a layout. So we can design where the EventListItem component is showing that it's loading while we're waiting for its content
- In src/features/events/eventDashboard folder, create a component/file called EventListItemPlaceholder.jsx
- In EventListItemPlaceholder.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic components: `import { Segment, Button, Placeholder } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write a EventListItemPlaceholder functional component that renders a loading placeholder using Semantic UI
    ```javascript
    export default function EventListItemPlaceholder() {
      return (
        <Placeholder fluid>
          <Segment.Group>
            <Segment style={{ minHeight: 110 }}>
              <Placeholder>
                <Placeholder.Header image>
                  <Placeholder.Line />
                  <Placeholder.Line />
                </Placeholder.Header>
                <Placeholder.Paragraph>
                  <Placeholder.Line />
                </Placeholder.Paragraph>
              </Placeholder>
            </Segment>
            <Segment>
              <Placeholder>
                <Placeholder.Line />
                <Placeholder.Line />
              </Placeholder>
            </Segment>
            <Segment secondary style={{ minHeight: 70 }} />
            <Segment clearing>
              <Button disabled color='blue' floated='right' content='View' />
            </Segment>
          </Segment.Group>
        </Placeholder>
      );
    }
    ```
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import the EventListItemPlaceholder component: `import EventListItemPlaceholder from './EventListItemPlaceholder';`
  - Just above the `<EventList />` component, write a condition that checks if loading state is true
  - If it is, render the EventListItemPlaceholder component
    ```javascript
    {loading && (
      <>
        <EventListItemPlaceholder />
        <EventListItemPlaceholder />
      </>
    )}
    ```

### [8. Adding an event filters component: EventFilters](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/365f143fe921ae9bf96694003efef29c9d6d0c07)
- We want our user to be able to filter the event list based on the filter setting. They can also filter the events by selecting a date on a calendar. These filters will be on the right hand column of the EventDashboard page. We will use a react-calendar widget library for the calendar
- Install React Calendar widget library:
  - `npm i react-calendar`
- In src/features/events/eventDashboard folder, create a component/file called EventFilters.jsx
- In EventFilters.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic components: `import { Header, Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Import the Calendar component: `import Calendar from 'react-calendar';`
  - Write an EventFilters component that renders a filter menu and a select date calendar widget using Semantic UI
    ```javascript
    export default function EventFilters() {
      return (
        <>
          <Menu vertical size='large' style={{ width: '100%' }}>
            <Header icon='filter' attached color='teal' content='Filters' />
            <Menu.Item content='All Events' />
            <Menu.Item content="I'm going" />
            <Menu.Item content="I'm hosting" />
          </Menu>
          <Header icon='calendar' attached color='teal' content='Select date' />
          <Calendar />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import the EventFilters component: `import EventFilters from './EventFilters';`
  - In the 6-width grid column, render the EventFilters component
    ```javascript
    <Grid.Column width={6}>
      <EventFilters />
    </Grid.Column>
    ```
- In index.js file:
  - Import the react-calendar stylesheet right after the react-toastify stylesheet
    - `import 'react-calendar/dist/Calendar.css';`
- In styles.css file:
  - Style the react-calendar so that it takes up the full width of the column
  ```css
  .react-calendar {
    width: 100%;
    border: none;
    box-shadow: 0 1px 2px 0 rgba(34, 36, 38, .15);
  }
  ```


## INTRO TO FIRESTORE

**Firestore**
- Firestore is another type of database in the Firebase architecture
- Firestore is an area where we can have Collections contain Documents. Those Documents can contain Collections. And the Documents can contain Fields. The Fields can be key/value pairs or objects. An object is made up of key/value properties
- Firestore is NOT a relational database. Firestore is more optimized for reading data rather than writing database
- NoSQL database. That means we can't write structured-query-language queries to query database
- More structured than Firebase. Firebase was just one giant json document of keys and values
- Easier to query, can sort and filter at the same time
- Scalable

**Realtime database** 
- We maintain a persistent connection to the database. And anytime there's an update, anybody who's browsing our application and listening to that particular collection in Firestore, will get live updates
- For example, if somebody creates a new event in our application and we send that up to Firestore, then anybody who's connected is also going to receive live of that event
- This means that we don't have to write Javascript code to update our application because we maintain that connection to Firestore. As soon as Firestore is updated, then we get the updates on our application without needing to do the extra work

### [1. Setting up Firebase and Firestore](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/873629bc651bfaf662a0d69e4617df38ad8aad3d)
- Website: https://console.firebase.google.com/
- Click the 'Add project' button to create a new project. Give the project a name. If the billing plan screen pops up, choose a different project name
- Disable the Google Analytics for this project
- Next is we need to add configuration to our application. Under Home menu, click on the 'Web' icon
  - Register the app and give the app a nickname. Call it revents
  - It then gives us a whole bunch of keys and information about the configuration of our Firebase project
  - Copy the code inside the firebaseConfig body
- In src/app/config folder, create a file called firebase.js
- In firebase.js file:
  - Create a firebaseConfig object and paste in the code
    ```javascript
    const firebaseConfig = {
      PASTE_CODE_HERE
    }
    ```
  - After installing the Firebase Javascript SDK, we can import various aspects and individual elements of Firebase we want to use in our our app
    ```javascript
    import firebase from 'firebase/app';
    import 'firebase/firestore';
    import 'firebase/database';
    import 'firebase/auth';
    import 'firebase/storage';
    ```
  - We can then initialize our app with firebase and initialize the firestore part
    ```javascript
    firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    firebase.firestore();

    export default firebase;
    ```
- Install the Firebase Javascript SDK
  - `npm i firebase`

### [2. Firestore document fields](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/1e773950558d658f6ee2460d00d1922701186dee)
- We're going to manually add data to Firestore to get a feel of the database structure
- There are two types of database we can create. One is the Firebase database and the other is the Firestore database. We want the 'Cloud Firestore' database. Select this in the menu bar
- Click on the 'Create database' button. Select the 'Start in test mode' option
- On the Cloud Firestore page, click on the 'Start collection' button and give the Collection an ID. Call it events
- In the events Collection, 
  - auto-generate a Document ID
  - fill out the document with the details of an event we've been using. For example,
    - a Field is title, with a Type of string, and a Value of Firestore test event
    - next Field is category, with a Type of string, and a Value of travel
    - the Type for a date Field is timestamp
    - the Type for an object Field is map
    - the Type for attendees Field is an array. Each item in the array is an object Field

### [3. Listening to Firestore data](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/deba6bae3d139f45e1bea8a39799ba3789572d83)
- Now that we have some data in Firestore, let's implement how we can get the data into our application
- In src/app/firestore folder, create a file called firestoreService.js. This file stores our Firebase and Firestore queries
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Import firebase from our config: `import firebase from '../config/firebase';`
  - Access the Firestore db:
    - `const db = firebase.firestore();`
  - There are two ways to get data from Firestore. We can either listen to the data or get the data. Use .onSnapshot() method to listen to the data 
    - The .onSnapshot() method takes an observer as an argument
  - Write a getEventsFromFirestore function that gets the events collection from Firestore
    - This function takes an observer as an argument
    - To get a specific collection from Firestore, use db.collection(), and pass in the name of the collection
    - The .onSnapshot() method listens to the data on Firestore and it takes an observer as an argument
    ```javascript
    export function getEventsFromFirestore(observer) {
      return db.collection('events').onSnapshot(observer);
    }
    ```
- When we're in a component and we want to do something, such as query an API, we use useEffect() hook from React. This allows us to do something when the component mounts and dismounts
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import useEffect() hook: `import React, { useEffect } from 'react';`
  - Call the useEffect() hook:
    - The useEffect() hook takes a callback function
    - When it comes to Firestore, we're going to subscribe, so we're listening to the data, and then we're going to unsubscribe. We're going to subscribe when the component mounts and unsubscribe when the component unmounts
    - In this callback function:
      - Specify an unsubscribe function variable and set it equal to the getEventsFromstore() function
      - In this getEventsFromstore() function, we need to pass in an observer. What we get back from this function is:
        - a `next` handler. And this is going to be what happens next after we received the data back from Firestore, what do we want to do next with it. Now, our data comes back from Firestore as a snapshot. This snapshot is a collection, so it'll return to us an array of documents in the form of `snapshot.docs`. We can use the .map() method to loop over the array to get the individual event, `docSnapshot`. Then inside this `docSnapshot` we can get the data from the events using `docSnapshot.data()`
        - an error. We're going to console log the error for now
    - Everything inside this callback function is what's going to happen when the component mounts. And because we're listening to something, we're subscribing to something, and then we want to do something when the component unmounts
    - In our case, we want to return a function inside this useEffect() hook when the component unmounts. We return the unsubscrible function in order to unsubscribe from listening to the Firestore data when the component unmounts. When the return function is called, this is what is called when the component unmounts. So anything we add inside this return is effectively going to take an action to unsubscribe from listening to the data: `return unsubscribe;`
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      const unsubscribe = getEventsFromFirestore({
        next: (snapshot) =>
          console.log(snapshot.docs.map((docSnapshot) => docSnapshot.data())),
        error: (error) => console.log(error)
      });
      return unsubscribe;
    });
    ```

### [4. Shaping the Firestore data and getting it into Redux store](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/35aa9b3881cc11470eaee1ec132fc2498163f6b0)
- The data we get back from Firestore has missing document id and the format of the date property is Firestore Timestamp, which is not usable for us. A common thing to do with Firebase and Firestore is shape the data so it's usable in our application. We're going to create a function to help us do that
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Write a dataFromSnapshot function that makes changes to the data from snapshot and returns the new version of data
    - This function takes snapshot as an argument
    - First thing we want to check is if snapshot exists
      - If it doesn't, return undefined
      - If it does exist, we want to get the data out of the snapshot by calling `snapshot.data()` and assign it to data variable
    - What we return from this function as an object is: the existing data and the id from snapshot.id 
    ```javascript
    export function dataFromSnapshot(snapshot) {
      // If snapshot doesn't exist, return undefined
      if (!snapshot.exists) return undefined;
      // If it does exist, get the data from snapshot
      const data = snapshot.data();

      // Return the existing data and the id from snapshot.id
      return {
        ...data,
        id: snapshot.id
      };
    }
    ```
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import the dataFromSnapshot function: `import { dataFromSnapshot } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';`
  - When mapping through each docSnapshot, we want to call the dataFromSnapshot() function and pass in docSnapshot as an argument
    - `console.log(snapshot.docs.map((docSnapshot) => dataFromSnapshot(docSnapshot)))`
  - Now the data we get back should include an id property with the document id
- Next is we want to convert Firestore timestap date into Javascript date
- Back in firestoreService.js file and inside the dataFromSnapshot() function:
  - We want to check to see the type of object we get back inside the data. So we're going to loop over all the properties inside the snapshot data. If a property of the data object is a Firestore Timestamp, then we want to convert it into a Javascript date object
  - The date property of data object that we get back from snapshot comes with a handful of methods, and one of those methods is .toDate(). This method will convert the timestamp into Javascript date
  - `for (const prop in data) { ... }` this is going to loop over all the properties/prop inside the data object
  - The `if (data.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {...}` is checking for the data properties only, excluding other types of properties
  - Then check to see if the data[prop] is an instance of firebase.firestore.Timestamp. And if it is, we can all the .toDate() method on that data[prop]. And then assign this Javascript date object back to data[prop]
  ```javascript
	for (const prop in data) {
		if (data.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
			if (data[prop] instanceof firebase.firestore.Timestamp) {
				data[prop] = data[prop].toDate();
			}
		}
  }
  ```
- Now that we have a data in a format that we can use, we'll create a new action creator in our Redux store, so we can pass the events that we get back from Firestore into the eventReducer
- In eventActions.js file:
  - Write a listenToEvents action creator function that returns as an object, a FETCH_EVENTS action and a payload property of events
    - This function takes events as an argument
    ```javascript
    export function listenToEvents(events) {
      return {
        type: FETCH_EVENTS,
        payload: events
      };
    }
    ```
- In index.js file:
  - We no longer load events directly from our store anymore. We will load events from Firestore instead
  - Remove this and the loadEvents import: `store.dispatch(loadEvents());`
- Back in EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import useDispatch() hook: `import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';`
  - Import the listToEvents() action: `import { listenToEvents } from '../eventActions';`
  - Create a dispatch() method using the useDispatch() hook
    - `const dispatch = useDispatch();`
  - Now we can dispatch the listenToEvents() action to get the events from Firestore and store the events in the eventReducer. Note that the listenToEvents() action is using the FETCH_EVENTS action type and the payload of events to store the events from Firestore in Redux store
    - The listenToEvents() action takes events as an argument. And the events is the snapshot from Firestore
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      const unsubscribe = getEventsFromFirestore({
        next: (snapshot) =>
          dispatch(
            listenToEvents(
              snapshot.docs.map((docSnapshot) => dataFromSnapshot(docSnapshot))
            )
          ),
        error: (error) => console.log(error)
      });
      return unsubscribe;
    });
    ```
  - Now on the EventDashboard page, we can see the event information is coming from Firestore
  - A note on the useEffect() hook:
    - When we use useEffect(), we need to be careful of how many it's going to run. Every time this component receives properties, or the state reload, or something is changing, the component will re-renders and the code inside the useEffect() hook will run as well
    - When using useEffect() hook, we also need to provide it an array of dependencies as a 2nd argument. This ensures that the component only re-renders when there's a change in the listed dependencies
    - We only want to listen to the Firestore data when the component mount and unlisten when the component unmounts. We don't want to call this action everytime the component re-renders
    - In our case, the dependency is the dispatch() method. We can list dispatch as a dependency in the dependency array
      - `useEffect(callback, [dispatch])`

### [5. Restoring the loading indicator](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/a546f0e5440b2e13c4f878f232e91eaf9aab3e0e)
- What happens when we listen to data from Firestore is we don't get a promise from Firestore. We're objserving the data
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import async actions: `import { asyncActionError, asyncActionFinish, asyncActionStart } from '../../../app/async/asyncReducer';`
  - Inside useEffect() hook:
    - Before we start listening to Firestore data, we can turn on the loading indicator by dispatching the asyncActionStart() action
    - Once we have the data, we can turn off the loading indicator by dispatching the asyncActionFinish() action
    - Also if there's an error returned, dispatch the asyncActionError() action to store the error in Redux store
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      dispatch(asyncActionStart());
      const unsubscribe = getEventsFromFirestore({
        next: (snapshot) => {
          dispatch(
            listenToEvents(
              snapshot.docs.map((docSnapshot) => dataFromSnapshot(docSnapshot))
            )
          );
          dispatch(asyncActionFinish());
        },
        error: (error) => dispatch(asyncActionError(error))
      });
      return unsubscribe;
    }, [dispatch]);
    ```

### [6. Creating a custom hook: useFirestoreCollection() hook](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/98ea71007b00081314a8e94a1bb57ea427225d42)
- Up until now we've been using other people's hooks to write our application. Our useEffect() hook is getting long with more actions being dispatched. We can write our own custom hook so it can be reusable 
- In src/app/hooks folder, create a file called useFirestoreCollection.js
  - By convention, whenever creating a hook, start with 'use'
- In useFirestoreCollection.js file:
  - Import dispatch() hook: `import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";`
  - Import useEffect() hook: `import { useEffect } from "react";`
  - Import async actions: `import { asyncActionError, asyncActionFinish, asyncActionStart } from "../async/asyncReducer";`
  - Import the dataFromSnapshot function: `import { dataFromSnapshot } from "../firestore/firestoreService";`
  - Write a useFirestoreCollection custom hook
    - This hook takes query, data, and deps as parameters in an object
      - `export default function useFirestoreCollection({ query, data, deps }) {..}`
      - The query: the Firestore query we want to use
      - The data: what to do when we receive the data back from the query
      - The deps: any dependencies that the useEffect() hook need
    - We can use hooks inside a hook
    - Create a dispatch method using useDispatch() hook
      - `const dispatch = useDispatch();`
    - Call the useEffect() hook:
      - This hook takes a callback function as 1st arg and an array of dependencies as 2nd arg
      - Inside the callback function:
        - Dispatch the asyncActionStart() action
        - Then create an unsubscribe function that queries Firestore to get the snapshot using query().onSnapshot() methods
        - The .onSnapshot() takes an observer as an argument
        - Once the snapshot comes back,
          - transform the snapshot into a usable format using the dataFromSnapshot() method and assign it to docs variable
          - set the data property and pass in the docs
          - dispatch the asyncActionFinish() action
        - If there's an error, dispatch the asyncActionError() action to store the error
      - The useEffect() hook returns a callback function and call the unsubscribe() function inside the callback. This will unsubscribe to Firestore when the component unmounts
      - Lastly, pass in the dependencies this useEffect() hook needs. Now, we're not going to pass the deps inside an array here, but we're going to pass it from the component that uses this custom hook
        - eslint will throw a warning about this and we can disable the warning
    ```javascript
    export default function useFirestoreCollection({ query, data, deps }) {
      const dispatch = useDispatch();

      useEffect(() => {
        dispatch(asyncActionStart())
        const unsubscribe = query().onSnapshot(
          snapshot => {
            const docs = snapshot.docs.map(doc => dataFromSnapshot(doc))
            data(docs)
            dispatch(asyncActionFinish())
          },
          error => dispatch(asyncActionError(error))
        )
        return () => {
          unsubscribe()
        }
      }, deps) //eslint-disable-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
    }
    ```
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - We're going to change the functioning and the name of the getEventsFromFirestore function. This function will be listening to events from Firestore and returns the events collection. It's no longer getting the snapshot as the useFirestoreCollection custom hook will handle that
    ```javascript
    // A query function
    export function listenToEventsFromFirestore() {
      return db.collection('events');
    }
    ```
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import the firestoreService() custom hook: `import useFirestoreCollection from '../../../app/hooks/useFirestoreCollection';`
  - Import the listenToEvents() action: `import { listenToEvents } from '../eventActions';`
  - Import the listenToEventsFromFirestore query function: `import { listenToEventsFromFirestore } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';`
  - Instead of using useEffect() hook, we're going to use the firestoreService() hook
    - This custom hook takes query, data, and deps parameters as an object
    - For query param, it's going to call the listenToEventsFromFirestore() method
    - For data param, the arrow function will take events that we got back from the query as an argument and then dispatches the listenToEvents() action that takes the events as an argument
    - For deps param, list dispatch as a dependency in the dependencies array
    ```javascript
    useFirestoreCollection({
      query: () => listenToEventsFromFirestore(),
      data: (events) => dispatch(listenToEvents(events)),
      deps: [dispatch]
    });
    ```

### [7. Adding a useFirestoreDoc() hook](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/4ee912a69203b2c3b92e18406f5a56ba03ae854b)
- We want to get individual documents rather than a collection from Firestore. We need to create another custom hook and a query function to get a document from Firestore
- In src/app/hooks folder, create a file called useFirestoreDoc.js
- In useFirestoreDoc.js file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import { useEffect } from "react";
    import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
    import { asyncActionError, asyncActionFinish, asyncActionStart } from "../async/asyncReducer";
    import { dataFromSnapshot } from "../firestore/firestoreService";
    ```
  - Write a useFirestoreDoc custom hook that listens to Firestore when component mounts and unsubscribe when the component unmounts
    - The snapshot that it comes back is a document based on the eventId
    ```javascript
    export default function useFirestoreDoc({ query, data, deps }) {
      const dispatch = useDispatch();

      useEffect(() => {
        dispatch(asyncActionStart())
        const unsubscribe = query().onSnapshot(
          snapshot => {
            data(dataFromSnapshot(snapshot))
            dispatch(asyncActionFinish())
          },
          error => dispatch(asyncActionError(error))
        )
        return () => {
          unsubscribe()
        }
      }, deps) //eslint-disable-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
    }
    ```
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Create a listenToEventFromFirestore function that queries the events collection in Firestore and returns a document based on an event id
    - This function take an eventId as an argument
    ```javascript
    export function listenToEventFromFirestore(eventId) {
      return db.collection('events').doc(eventId);
    }
    ```
- In EventDetailedPage.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
    import { listenToEventFromFirestore } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';
    import useFirestoreDoc from '../../../app/hooks/useFirestoreDoc';
    import { listenToEvents } from '../eventActions';
    import LoadingComponent from '../../../app/layout/LoadingComponent';
    ```
  - Create a dispatch method using useDispatch hook
    - `const dispatch = useDispatch();`
  - Use useFirestoreDoc() hook
    - This custom hook takes query, data, and deps parameters as an object
    - If there's a change in eventId in the URL params, the component will re-render and what's inside the custom hook will run
    ```javascript
    useFirestoreDoc({
      query: () => listenToEventFromFirestore(match.params.id),
      data: (event) => dispatch(listenToEvents([event])),
      deps: [match.params.id, dispatch]
    });
    ```
  - Because we're going to wait for the event to come back from Firestore, we're going to add the loading indicator as well
  - Extract the loading property from the asyncReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { loading } = useSelector((state) => state.async);`
  - Check to see if it's loading or if there's no event. If one of these cases is true, return the `<LoadingComponent />`
    - `if (loading || !event) return <LoadingComponent content='Loading event...' />;`

### [8. Handling not found documents](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/8e7d760418f5464baa98b2743451d2b4b1408a62)
- When we try to fetch an event from Redux store or from Firestore, we use the event id from the URL params of the EventDetailedPage. When we try to get a document in Firestore based on the event id and it can't find it, Firestore will not return an error. However, it will still return a snapshot object and in the snapshot, there's an exists property that's set to false
- We can use this exists property to check if a document data is found in Firestore. If this exists property is false, we can dispatch an asynActionError() action and provide a custom code and message about the error
- In useFirestoreDoc.js file:
  - Write a condition to check if snapshot.exists property is false
  - If it is, dispatch the asynActionError() action and provide a custom error code and message
  - And then return. This means the function will stop executing anything after
  ```javascript
  useEffect(() => {
      dispatch(asyncActionStart());
      const unsubscribe = query().onSnapshot(
        (snapshot) => {
          if (!snapshot.exists) {
            dispatch(
              asyncActionError({
                code: 'not-found',
                message: 'could not find document'
              })
            );
            return;
          }
          data(dataFromSnapshot(snapshot));
          dispatch(asyncActionFinish());
        },
        (error) => dispatch(asyncActionError(error))
      );
      return () => {
        unsubscribe();
      };
    }, deps); //eslint-disable-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  ```

### [9. Adding an error component: ErrorComponent](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/c7001a61c132678a5623cd155e5a980c9b00632b)
- The current problem we're having is if no event document is found, the `<LoadingComponent />` continues to run. So we're going to create an error component to handle errors and redirect user
- In src/app/common/errors folder, create a component/file called ErrorComponent.jsx
- In ErrorComponent.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
    import { Button, Header, Segment } from 'semantic-ui-react';
    import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
    ```
  - Write an ErrorComponent functional component that displays an error message and a button that directs the user to the events page
    - Extract the error property from asyncReducer using useSelector() hook
      - `const { error } = useSelector((state) => state.async);`
    ```javascript
    export default function ErrorComponent() {
      const { error } = useSelector((state) => state.async);

      return (
        <Segment placeholder>
          <Header
            textAlign='center'
            content={error?.message || 'Oops - we have an error'}
          />
          <Button
            as={Link}
            to='/events'
            primary
            style={{ marginTop: 20 }}
            content='Return to events page'
          />
        </Segment>
      );
    }
    ```
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import the ErrorComponent: `import ErrorComponent from '../common/errors/ErrorComponent';`
  - Create a route for the ErrorComponent
    - `<Route path='/error' component={ErrorComponent} />`
- In EventDetailedPage.jsx file:
  - Import the Redirect component: `import { Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Extract the error property from asyncReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { loading, error } = useSelector((state) => state.async);`
  - If loading is true or if there's no event and no error, return with the LoadingComponent
    - `if (loading || (!event && !error)) return <LoadingComponent content='Loading event...' />;`
  - Write a condition that checks for the error state. If there's an error, return with the Redirect component and set the path to '/error'. The route of this '/error' path will render the ErrorComponent and display the error page
    - `if (error) return <Redirect to='/error' />;`

### [10. Creating and updating events in Firestore](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/a51888a1743c9b03cd1d45bfed0753382f53f421)
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import useFirestoreDoc from '../../../app/hooks/useFirestoreDoc';
    import { listenToEventFromFirestore } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';
    import { listenToEvents } from '../eventActions';
    import LoadingComponent from '../../../app/layout/LoadingComponent';
    import { Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
    import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
    ```
  - Extract the loading and error properties from asyncReducer using useSelect() hook
    - `const { error, loading } = useSelector((state) => state.async);`
  - When we want to update an event by clicking on the 'Manage Event' button, it'll route to the update event form and the event information is populated in the input fields. However, when we refesh the page, the event information is no longer there. The data doesn't persist. We need to load the event info from Firestore when the component mounts
  - Use the useFirestoreDoc() custom hook we wrote for the EventDetailedPage component
  - Also the conditional logic to display the loading indicator
  - Also the conditional logic to display the error page
    ```javascript
    useFirestoreDoc({
      query: () => listenToEventFromFirestore(match.params.id),
      data: (event) => dispatch(listenToEvents([event])),
      deps: [match.params.id, dispatch]
    });

    if (loading || (!selectedEvent && !error))
      return <LoadingComponent content='Loading event...' />;

    if (error) return <Redirect to='/error' />;
    ```
- Next is we need to create query functions that will add an event and update an event in Firestore
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Write an addEventToFirestore function that adds an event to Firestore
    - This function takes an event as an argument
    - It will first query the events collection and then call the .add() method
    - The add() method adds a new document to the collection and automatically assigns a document ID. It returns a Promise resolved with a DocumentReference pointing to the newly created document after it has been written to the backend
    - To add an array, usefirebase.firestore.FieldValue.arrayUnion() method
    - Since we don't have any users at the moment, we're going to add the data manually
    ```javascript
    export function addEventToFirestore(event) {
      return db.collection('events').add({
        ...event,
        hostedBy: 'Diana',
        hostPhotoURL: 'https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/28.jpg',
        attendees: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.arrayUnion({
          id: cuid(),
          displayName: 'Diana',
          photoURL: 'https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/28.jpg'
        })
      });
    }
    ```
  - Write an updateEventInFirestore query function that updates an event in Firestore
    - This function takes an event as an argument
    - It will first query the events collection, then the event document with the id, and then call the .update() method to update the event
    ```javascript
    export function updateEventInFirestore(event) {
      return db.collection('events').doc(event.id).update(event);
    }
    ```
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import toast method: `import { toast } from 'react-toastify';`
  - Import addEventToFirestore and updateEventInFirestore functions: `import { addEventToFirestore, updateEventInFirestore } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';`
  - In handling the onSubmit form event:
    - First extract the setSubmitting method from Formik
    - We'll submit the form in an try/catch block since this is an asynchronous action. This way, we can catch the error if we can't add or update an event in Firestore
    - If error, call toast.error() method to display a notification with the error message and setSubmitting() to false. When isSubmitting is true, the loading indicator is on and we don't want it to be on forever
    - Next, instead of dispatching the updateEvent() and the createEvent() actions, we'll use the updateEventInFirestore() and addEventToFirestore() query functions and pass in the values as argument. This will take the values from the EventForm and update or add the event in Firestore
    - Since this is an async operation, we'll need to turn the arrow function into an async/await function. Add the async keyword in front of the arrow function and add the await keyword in front of the updateEventInFirestore() function and also in front of the addEventToFirestore() function
    - After adding or updating an event, setSubmitting() back to false. And then direct user to the events page
    ```javascript
    onSubmit={async (values, { setSubmitting }) => {
      try {
        selectedEvent
          ? await updateEventInFirestore(values)
          : await addEventToFirestore(values);
        setSubmitting(false);
        history.push('/events');
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error(error.message);
        setSubmitting(false);
      }
    }}
    ```

### [11. Fix an issue w/ Create Event, sort events by date](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/7072124e1b3170e69440dca0304943577137a03c)
- We're running into a problem when we click on the 'Create Event' button to create a new event. The useFirestoreDoc() hook runs and tries to find an event document id in Firestore. Obviously when we first try to create a new event, there isn't an event id. When we're creating an new event, we don't want to run the useEffect()/useFirestoreDoc() hook which trigger the query in Firestore. However, we cannot stop running a useEffect() hook and that's the rule
- To work around this issue, we can write a condition to exit out of the useFirestoreDoc() hook and thus listening to Firestore doesn't start when we're creating a new event
- In useFirestoreDoc.js file:
  - Add another parameter shouldExecute and set it to true by default
    - `export default function useFirestoreDoc({ query, data, deps, shouldExecute = true }) {..}`
  - Then inside the useEffect() hook, add the conditional logic to exit out of the hook if shouldExecute is false
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      if (!shouldExecute) return;
      // rest of code
    }
    ```
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Pass in the shouldExecute parameter to the useFirestoreDoc() hook
    - And set the match.params.id to a boolean. If there isn't an event id, shouldExecute will set to false. And this will exit out of the useEffect()/useFirestoreDoc() hook
    ```javascript
    useFirestoreDoc({
      shouldExecute: !!match.params.id,
      query: () => listenToEventFromFirestore(match.params.id),
      data: (event) => dispatch(listenToEvents([event])),
      deps: [match.params.id, dispatch]
    });
    ```
- When listing the events on the events page, we can sort the order of listing by date
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Add the .orderBy() method and pass in date
  ```javascript
  export function listenToEventsFromFirestore() {
    return db.collection('events').orderBy('date');
  }
  ```

### [12. Deleting an event](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/c42f52b336419c244b9d53b4d099ada5eaee9c4a)
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Write a deleteEventInFirestore function to delete an event in Firestore
    - This function takes an eventId as an argument
    ```javascript
    export function deleteEventInFirestore(eventId) {
      return db.collection('events').doc(eventId).delete();
    }
    ```
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - Import the deleteEventInFirestore function: `import { deleteEventInFirestore } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';`
  - In the 'Delete' Button element:
    - Replace the dispatch deleteEvent() action with the deleteEventInFirestore() function and pass in the event.id
    - This will remove an event in Firestore
    ```javascript
    <Button
      onClick={() => deleteEventInFirestore(event.id)}
      color='red'
      floated='right'
      content='Delete'
    />
    ```
  - In our application, however, the user won't be able to delete an event. They can cancel an event instead

### [13. Cancelling an event function](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/80fd9fcd548b10cb1febad416ee970114428f1f6)
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Write a cancelEventToggle function that toggles the cancel state of an event
    - This function takes an event as an argument
    - We're using the .update() method to toggle the isCancelled property
    - If isCancelled property is true, then the event is cancelled
    ```javascript
    export function cancelEventToggle(event) {
      return db.collection('events').doc(event.id).update({
        isCancelled: !event.isCancelled
      });
    }
    ```
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import the cancelEventToggle function: `import { cancelEventToggle } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';`
  - Add a Button element that toggles between 'Reactivate event' and 'Cancel event'
    - On onClick event handling, execute the cancelEventToggle() function in an arrow function and pass in the selectedEvent
    - Also, we only want to show this button when a user is managing an event, not when creating an event. We need to write a condition to only show this button when an event is selected
    ```javascript
    {selectedEvent && (
      <Button
        type='button'
        floated='left'
        color={selectedEvent.isCancelled ? 'green' : 'red'}
        content={
          selectedEvent.isCancelled
            ? 'Reactivate Event'
            : 'Cancel Event'
        }
        onClick={() => cancelEventToggle(selectedEvent)}
      />
    )}
    ```
- Next is, if an event is cancelled, we want to add a label to the event saying that this event has been cancelled
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - Right after the Item.Description tag, write a condition to see if the event isCancelled. If it is, add a Label element with the content saying 'This event has been cancelled'
    ```javascript
    {event.isCancelled && (
      <Label
        style={{ top: '-40px' }}
        ribbon='right'
        color='red'
        content='This event has been cancelled'
      />
    )}
    ```

### [14. Adding a confirmation prompt](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/e813ac0c831b2e60d5f43d154c8be425b704b410)
- When the user clicks on the 'Cancel Event' or 'Reactivate Event' button, we want to display a confirmation dialog box for them to confirm. Semantic UI has a Confirm component that we can use to achieve this
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import the cancelEventToggle function: `import { cancelEventToggle } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';`
  - Import Semantic Confirm component: `import { Confirm } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Create a loadingCancel state using useState() hook and initialize its value to false
    - `const [loadingCancel, setLoadingCancel] = useState(false);`
  - Create a confirmOpen state using useState() hook and initialize its value to false
    - `const [confirmOpen, setConfirmOpen] = useState(false);`
  - Write an async handleCancelToggle function to handle the onConfirm event from the Confirm component. onConfirm, this function executes the cancelEventToggle() function to toggle the isCancelled property in Firestore
    - This function takes an event as an argument
    - Toggle the isCancelled property in a try/catch block
    - Since this is an async operation where it takes sometime to complete, we want to indicate the loading state as well
    - If there's an error, use toast.error() method to send a notification that an error has occurred
    ```javascript
    async function handleCancelToggle(event) {
      setConfirmOpen(false);
      setLoadingCancel(true);
      try {
        await cancelEventToggle(event);
        setLoadingCancel(false);
      } catch (error) {
        setLoadingCancel(true);
        toast.error(error.message);
      }
    }
    ```
  - In the 'Cancel Event' or 'Reactivate Event' Button element:
    - Add a loading property and set it to loadingCancel state
    - On the onClick event handling, call the setConfirmOpen() and set it to true. So when the button is clicked, the Confirm dialog box will open
    ```javascript
    {selectedEvent && (
      <Button
        loading={loadingCancel}
        type='button'
        floated='left'
        color={selectedEvent.isCancelled ? 'green' : 'red'}
        content={
          selectedEvent.isCancelled
            ? 'Reactivate Event'
            : 'Cancel Event'
        }
        onClick={() => setConfirmOpen(true)}
      />
    )}
    ```
  - Right after the `<Formik />` component, instantiate the Semantic UI `<Confirm />` component
    - If the 'Cancel' button is clicked, the Confirm dialog box will close
    - If the 'Confirm' button is clicked, the handleCancelToggle() function is executed
    - Depending on the isCancelled state, one of the two messages will display
    ```javascript
    <Confirm
      content={
        selectedEvent?.isCancelled
          ? 'This will reactivate the event - are you sure?'
          : 'This will cancel the event - are you sure?'
      }
      open={confirmOpen}
      onCancel={() => setConfirmOpen(false)}
      onConfirm={() => handleCancelToggle(selectedEvent)}
    />
    ```


## AUTHENTICATION

**Firebase Authentication**
- Tightly integrated with Firebase services. We use this to secure our application when we create some security rules
- Token based (JWT). Uses Jason Web Token to pass with every request that goes to Firebase and Firestore. And it is stored in the client's browser for persistence
- Email and password. We can use email and password for authentication
- Social logins. Can also utilize social logins like Facebook and Google
- We will look into 3 options: email/password, Facebook, and Google

**Users**
- Firestore User properties
  - Unique ID (uid)
  - Email address
  - Name
  - PhotoURL
- Cannot add additional properties to the User object directly
- We're going store user profile which have more flexibility. Can store additional properties in Firestore

### [1. Logging in with Firebase](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/abfd8b83db3041faa7a088826b1540cc34a50d45)
- Go to Google Firebase console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
- Click on Authentication in main menu. Then in Authentication page, select 'Sign-in method' at the top menu bar
  - It'll list all the different options
  - Enable Email/Password, the first item on the list
- Select 'Users' at the top menu bar
  - Click on 'Add user' button to add a user
  - Fill in the Email and Pasword for the user
  - Once a user is created, a user UID is created for this user
  - All the users are listed in this 'Users' tab
In src/app/firestore folder, create a file called firebaseService.js
- In firebaseService.js file:
  - Import firebase from config folder to get access to Firebase SDK: `import firebase from '../config/firebase';`
  - Write a signInWithEmail function that signs in a user in Firebase with email and password
    - This function takes creds as an argument
    - Call the firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword() method and pass in the email and password
    - Once this is submitted to Firebase auth, the result returned is information about this user. The result of this user will be used as a payload when dispatching the signInUser() action
    ```javascript
    export function signInWithEmail(creds) {
      return firebase
        .auth()
        .signInWithEmailAndPassword(creds.email, creds.password);
    }
    ```
- In authActions.js file:
  - Update the signInUser action function:
    - This function accepts user as an argument
    - This function returns an action object
      - with action type of SIGN_IN_USER
      - and payload of user. This payload contains information about this particular user when they signed in to Firebase
    ```javascript
    export function signInUser(user) {
      return {
        type: SIGN_IN_USER,
        payload: user
      };
    }
    ```
- In authReducer.jsx file:
  - Set the initialState object
    ```javascript
    const initialState = {
      authenticated: false,
      currentUser: null
    };
    ```

### [2. Persisting the login](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/853f6153a02b24a6544b9fecb787063aa7497ecd)
- What Firebase and Firestore uses to retain information inside the browser to persist things like user login is inside the Application/Storage/IndexedDB/firebaseLocalStorageDb
- When we login with a user or do anything with authentication, then Firebase gives us a listener for when the authentication state is changed. The `firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged()` method adds an observer for changes to the user's sign-in state. So when a user logs in or a user logs out, then this particular method is going to listen for that particular status. And then we can take actions when the authentication state is changed
- We'll use this method and what it returns is a Firebase user object. So we're going to check to see if we have a user. If a user is authenticated, then we have a user object
- In authActions.js file:
  - Import firebase from config folder to get access to Firebase SDK: `import firebase from '../../app/config/firebase';`
  - Write a verifyAuth action function that listens to the firebase authentication state change
    - This function returns a regular function that takes in a dispatch as an argument
    - Inside this return function, we're going to call the firebase.auth().onAuthStateChange() method. This method will return a user object
    - Write an if statement to check if there's a user
    - If there is a user, dispatch the signInUser() action and pass in the user object
    - If there isn't a user, dispatch the signOutUser() action. This function sets the authenticated property to false and the currentUser property to null
    ```javascript
    export function verifyAuth() {
      return function (dispatch) {
        return firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
          if (user) {
            dispatch(signInUser(user));
          } else {
            dispatch(signOutUser());
          }
        });
      };
    }
    ```
- We can dispatch this verifyAuth() action directly in our store configuration. So when we initialize our store, we dispatch this action, and we're going to be continuously listening to the authentication state
- In configureStore.js file:
  - Import the verifyAuth() action function: `import { verifyAuth } from '../../features/auth/authActions';`
  - We're going to make an adjustment to the store. We don't want to return the store directly. We want to do something to the store and then return the store
  - First, create a store variable and assign it to the createStore() method
  - Then dispatch the veryifyAuth() action to the store
  - Then return the store
    ```javascript
    export function configureStore() {
      // The createStore method takes a reducer and an enhancer as arguments
      const store = createStore(
        rootReducer,
        composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(thunk))
      );

      store.dispatch(verifyAuth());

      return store;
    }
    ```
- Next is we want add in a loading indicator when the user is logging in
- In LoginForm.jsx file:
  - Import the signInWithEmail function: `import { signInWithEmail } from '../../app/firestore/firebaseService';`
  - Since the signInWithEmail() function is an async function, we need to turn the arrow function that handles the onSubmit event into an async/await function
  - Also, we need to run the code inside a try/catch block
  - Call the signInWithEmail() method and pass in the values. Add the 'await' keyword in front of this function because we're waiting for this function to complete
    ```javascript
    onSubmit={async (values, { setSubmitting }) => {
      try {
        await signInWithEmail(values);
        setSubmitting(false);
        dispatch(closeModal());
      } catch (error) {
        setSubmitting(false);
        console.log(error);
      }
    }}
    ```

### [3. Signing out the user in Firebase](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/d4868677f6dc81d4bdf79b83e8fb9f1567c8f2ad)
- When a user clicks on the 'Sign out' button, we want them sign out in Firebase. We need to write a function to do this
- In firebaseService.js file:
  - Write a signOutFirebase function that signs out user in Firebase
    - This function doesn't take any arguments
    - Call the firebase.auth().signOut() method to sign out the user
    ```javascript
    export function signOutFirebase() {
      return firebase.auth().signOut();
    }
    ```
- In SignedInMenu.jsx file:
  - Import the signOutFirebase method: `import { signOutFirebase } from '../../app/firestore/firebaseService';`
  - Import toast: `import { toast } from 'react-toastify';`
  - Write an async handleSignOut function handler to sign out user in Firebase when the 'Sign out' button is clicked
    - Since this is an async function we'll run the code inside a try/catch block
    - If there's any problems with signing out, call the toast.error() method to display a notification of the error
    - Call the signOutFirebase() method and add the 'await' keyword in front of it
    - We want to wait for the signOutFirebase() function to complete, signed out in Firebase, before pushing the user to homepage.
    ```javascript
    async function handleSignOut() {
      try {
        await signOutFirebase();
        history.push('/');
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error(error.message);
      }
    }
    ```
  - On the onClick event for 'Sign out' Dropdown, call the handleSignOut method
    - `<Dropdown.Item onClick={handleSignOut} text='Sign out' icon='power' />`

### [4. Registering new users in Firebase: RegisterForm component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/ae41655bd3c837ffb6edec62572b928f02a69cfa)
- In src/features/auth folder, create a component/file called RegisterForm.jsx
- In RegisterForm.jsx file:
  - The RegisterForm is very similar to the the LoginForm. Copy and paste the code as starter
    - In the Form, add another MyTextInput component for displayName text input field
    - Add validation to displayName field in the validationSchema as well
    - Change the Button element to 'Register'
    - Add the header to say 'Register to Re-vents'
    ```javascript
    export default function RegisterForm() {
      const dispatch = useDispatch();

      return (
        <ModalWrapper size='mini' header='Register to Re-vents'>
          <Formik
            initialValues={{ displayName: '', email: '', password: '' }}
            validationSchema={Yup.object({
              displayName: Yup.string().required(),
              email: Yup.string().required().email(),
              password: Yup.string().required()
            })}
            onSubmit={async (values, { setSubmitting }) => {
              try {
                await registerInFirebase(values);
                setSubmitting(false);
                dispatch(closeModal());
              } catch (error) {
                setSubmitting(false);
                console.log(error);
              }
            }}
          >
            {({ isSubmitting, isValid, dirty }) => (
              <Form className='ui form'>
                <MyTextInput name='displayName' placeholder='displayName' />
                <MyTextInput name='email' placeholder='Email Address' />
                <MyTextInput
                  name='password'
                  placeholder='Password'
                  type='password'
                />
                <Button
                  loading={isSubmitting}
                  disabled={!isValid || !dirty || isSubmitting}
                  type='submit'
                  fluid
                  size='large'
                  color='teal'
                  content='Register'
                />
              </Form>
            )}
          </Formik>
        </ModalWrapper>
      );
    }
    ```
- Since this RegisterForm is a modal, we need to add this component to the modalLookup
- In ModalManager.jsx file:
  - Import the RegisterForm component: `import RegisterForm from '../../../features/auth/RegisterForm';`
  - Add the RegisterForm to the modalLookup object
    - `const modalLookup = { TestModal, LoginForm, RegisterForm };`
- In the SignedOutMenu.jsx file:
  - In the 'Register' Button element:
    - Add the onClick event handler where the openModal() function is going to dispatch and pass in the modalType of RegisterForm
    ```javascript
    <Button
      onClick={() => dispatch(openModal({ modalType: 'RegisterForm' }))}
      basic
      inverted
      content='Register'
      style={{ marginLeft: '0.5em' }}
    />
    ```
- In firebaseService.js file:
  - Write an async registerInFirebase function that registers a new user in Firebase
    - This function takes creds as an argument
    - Since this is an async function, we'll run our code in a try/catch block
    - If there's an error, we'll throw the error back to the register form
    - Call the firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword() method and pass in the email and password. The result we get back from this method is the user credentials
    - After this is done, we want to set a displayName property on the user object using the .updateProfile() method
    ```javascript
    export async function registerInFirebase(creds) {
      try {
        const result = await firebase
          .auth()
          .createUserWithEmailAndPassword(creds.email, creds.password);
        return await result.user.updateProfile({
          displayName: creds.displayName
        });
      } catch (error) {
        throw error;
      }
    }
    ```
- In RegisterForm.jsx file:
  - Import the registerInFirebase method: `import { registerInFirebase } from '../../app/firestore/firebaseService';`
  - On the onSubmit event handler, call the registerInFirebase() method inside the try block and pass in the values as an argument. Add the 'await' keyword in front of it since this is an async operation
    - `await registerInFirebase(values);`

### [5. Handling auth errors in LoginForm and RegisterForm](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/ac13eb8a6072ebed86e8434c5da8d9c1433b9d8d)
- In the LoginForm, we want to display an error message to the user if they aren't able to login
- In LoginForm.jsx file:
  - Import Semantic Label component: `import { Label } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - In the onSubmit event handler:
    - Extract the setErrors props from Formik
    - Inside the catch block:
      - Call the setErrors() method to set the auth key to an error message like 'Problem with username or password'
    ```javascript
    onSubmit={async (values, { setSubmitting, setErrors }) => {
      try {
        await signInWithEmail(values);
        setSubmitting(false);
        dispatch(closeModal());
      } catch (error) {
        setErrors({ auth: 'Problem with username or password' });
        setSubmitting(false);
      }
    }}
    ```
  - Then in the render props:
    - Extract the errors method props
      - `{({ isSubmitting, isValid, dirty, errors }) => ( .. )`
    - Just above the Button element, check to see if there's an error
    - If there is, render a Label with the error message displayed
    ```javascript
    {errors.auth && (
      <Label
        basic
        color='red'
        style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}
        content={errors.auth}
      />
    )}
    ```
- In the RegisterForm.jsx file:
  - Do the exact same thing as the LoginForm. But for the RegisterForm, we want to display the error.message coming from Firebase
    ```javascript
    onSubmit={async (values, { setSubmitting, setErrors }) => {
      try {
        await registerInFirebase(values);
        setSubmitting(false);
        dispatch(closeModal());
      } catch (error) {
        setErrors({ auth: error.message });
        setSubmitting(false);
      }
    }}
    ```

### [6. Setting user profile data in Firestore and Firebase](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/8bd7aa7c60c89e019754c1d800eed7490ab2c679)
- When we register a new user, we also want to add the user profile data into Firestore. By storing user profile in Firestore, we get live updates when they make changes to their profile information. So we're going to add profile data into Firestore database. Right now we have events collection in Firestore. We're going to have a collection of document for each user that registers to our application
- In firestoreService file:
  - Write a setUserProfileData function that creates a users collection in Firestore that contains a collection of user profile documents
    - This function takes user as an argument
    - Call the db.collection('users').doc(user.uid).set() method to create and set a document in a collection
      - We don't need to have a collection already in place. If the specified collection doesn't exist, it will create one
      - A .set() method allows us to specify a document reference (user.uid) ourselves even though we'er creating this document at the same time
      - Specify the document, the document's Fields, inside the .set() method
    ```javascript
    export function setUserProfileData(user) {
      return db.collection('users').doc(user.uid).set({
        displayName: user.displayName,
        email: user.email,
        createdAt: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
      });
    }
    ```
- After we've created the users database in Firestore, we also want to create the user profile in Firebase as well by calling the above function we created inside the Firebase's registerInFirebase() function
- In firebaseService file:
  - Import the setUserProfileData function: `import { setUserProfileData } from './firestoreService';`
  - In the registerInFirebase function:
    - Call the setUserProfileData() method and pass in result.user as an argument. Add the 'await' keyword in front of it because we need to wait for this function to complete. Also add 'return' in front of it, so that we can use the returned result in our application
    ```javascript
    export async function registerInFirebase(creds) {
      try {
        const result = await firebase
          .auth()
          .createUserWithEmailAndPassword(creds.email, creds.password);
        await result.user.updateProfile({
          displayName: creds.displayName
        });
        // Create a new user profile in Firebase
        return await setUserProfileData(result.user);
      } catch (error) {
        throw error;
      }
    }
    ```

### [7. Creating a social login component: SocialLogin component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/916774da98b3e40493a6a7a067ff49242186ca59)
- In src/features/auth folder, create a component/file called SocialLogin.jsx
- In SocialLogin.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic Button component: `import { Button } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write a SocialLogin functional component that renders a Facebook and Google login buttons 
    ```javascript
    export default function SocialLogin() {
      return (
        <>
          <Button icon='facebook' fluid color='facebook' style={{ marginBottom: 10 }} content='Login with Facebook' />
          <Button icon='google' fluid color='google plus' style={{ marginBottom: 10 }} content='Login with Google' />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```
- In LoginForm.jsx and RegisterForm.jsx files:
  - Import the SocialLogin component: `import SocialLogin from './SocialLogin';`
  - Inside the Form component:
    - Right after the Button element, add a horizontal Semantic Divider component with the text Or
    - Underneath that, render the SocialLogin component
    ```javascript
    <Divider horizontal>Or</Divider>
    <SocialLogin />
    ```

### [8. Facebook login setup](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/1055722ba69ad7994c4736247fb5458198cb3298)
- Go to Facebook developers website: https://developers.facebook.com/
- Once logged in with Facebook account, click on the 'Add a New project' button
- Select the 'For Everything Else' option. Give the project a name
- In Facebook developers dashboard
  - Click on Facebook Login -> Set Up button. Then select for the Web
- In the Settings menu on the left, click on Basic tab
  - Copy the App ID and copy the App Secret
- Go to Firebase Authentication page and under the 'Sign-in method' tab
  - Enable Facebook Sign-in
  - Paste in the App ID and App Secret
  - Copy the OAuth redirect URI underneath it
- In the Facebook Login menu on the left, click on Settings tab
  - We need to provide info for: Valid OAuth Redirect URIs
  - Paste in the OAuth Redirect URI
- In the Roles menu on the left, click on Test Users tab
  - Click on the 'Add' button
  - Add 2 Number of Test Users to Create
  - Once the Test Users are listed, change their names and give new passwords

### [9. Adding the Facebook login method](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/eece91426a8a393e19ee98d748cb9e40b79a4db3)
- In firebaseService.jsx file:
  - Import the setUserProfileData function : `import { setUserProfileData } from './firestoreService';`
  - Import toast: `import { toast } from 'react-toastify';`
  - Write an async socialLogin function that logs in a user with Facebook or Google. If this user logs in for the first time, create a user profile for them in Firestore and Firebase
    - This function takes a selectedProvider as an argument
    - First, add a provider variable
    - Then write an if statement to check if the selectedProivder is equal to facebook or google
      - If it is, set the provider variable to the new firebase facebook or google auth provider
    - After that, use a try/catch block to run the code
    - If there's an error, use toast.error() method to display the error.message
    - Inside the try block:
      - Call the firebase.auth().signInWithPopup() method and pass in the provider. Add an 'await' keyword in front of it since this is an async function. Assign the returned result to a result variable
      - Then write an if statement flag to check if this user is a new user. If it is, execute the setUserProfileData() method and pass in result.user as an argument. If this facebook user is a new user logging into our application, the setUserProfileData() method will create a user profile for them in Firestore and Firebase
    ```javascript
    export async function socialLogin(selectedProvider) {
      let provider;
      if (selectedProvider === 'facebook') {
        provider = new firebase.auth.FacebookAuthProvider();
      }
      if (selectedProvider === 'google') {
        provider = new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider();
      }
      try {
        const result = await firebase.auth().signInWithPopup(provider);
        console.log(result);
        if (result.additionalUserInfo.isNewUser) {
          await setUserProfileData(result.user);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error(error.message);
      }
    }
    ```
- In SocialLogin.jsx file:
  - Import useDispatch() hook: `import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';`
  - Import closeModal() action: `import {closeModal} from '../../app/common/modals/modalReducer'`
  - Import socialLogin function: `import { socialLogin } from '../../app/firestore/firebaseService';`
  - Create a dispatch method using useDispatch() hook
  - Write a handleSocialLogin function handler
    - This function takes a provider as an argument
    - Dispatch a closeModal() action
    - Call the socialLogin() function and pass in the provider
    ```javascript
    function handleSocialLogin(provider) {
      dispatch(closeModal());
      socialLogin(provider);
    }
    ```
  - In the 'Login with Google' and 'Login with Facebook' Button elements:
    - Add an onClick event and call the handleSocialLogin() handler inside an arrow function and pass in 'facebook' for Facebook login and 'google' for Google login as a provider argument
    ```javascript
    <Button
      onClick={() => handleSocialLogin('facebook')}
      icon='facebook'
      fluid
      color='facebook'
      style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}
      content='Login with Facebook'
    />
    <Button
      onClick={() => handleSocialLogin('google')}
      icon='google'
      fluid
      color='google plus'
      style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}
      content='Login with Google'
    />
    ```
- To test the Facebook login functionality:
  - Go to Facebook developers dashboard and get one of the Test Users email and password
  - When log in with Facebook. Type in the user email and password
  - Once the user is logged in,
    - This user is created and listed in the Firebase Authentication Users list
    - The user profile is also created for this user in Cloud Firestore in 'users' collection
  - When they log in for the very first time, the isNewUser property is set to true. When they log in again after that, the isNewUser property is set to false
- We can also display the user's profile picture once they're logged in
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - In the setUserProfileData function:
    - Add a photoURL property and set it to user.photoURL or null
    ```javascript
    export function setUserProfileData(user) {
      return db.collection('users').doc(user.uid).set({
        displayName: user.displayName,
        email: user.email,
        photoURL: user.photoURL || null,
        createdAt: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
      });
    }
    ```

### 10. Adding Google login
- Go to Google Firebase console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
- Click on Authentication in main menu. Then in Authentication page, select 'Sign-in method' at the top menu bar
- Enable Google Sign-in. Provide Project support email and click Save. Easy peasy

### [11. Adding an account page: AccountPage component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/76b1845362e2c84734486398343141eab7230cdf)
- In src/features/auth folder, create a component/file called AccountPage.jsx
- In AccountPage.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { Form, Formik } from 'formik';
    import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
    import { Button, Header, Label, Segment } from 'semantic-ui-react';
    import * as Yup from 'yup';
    import MyTextInput from '../../app/common/form/MyTextInput';
    ```
  - Write a AccountPage functional component that renders the user account page using Formik and Semantic UI
    - This account page allows user to change their password
    - If they signed in with Facebook or Google, buttons that take them to Facebook or Google website to update their account there
    ```javascript
    export default function AccountPage() {
      return (
        <Segment>
          <Header dividing size='large' content='Account' />
          <div>
            <Header color='teal' sub content='Change Password' />
            <p>Use this form to change your password</p>
            <Formik
              initialValues={{ newPassword1: '', newPassword2: '' }}
              validationSchema={Yup.object({
                newPassword1: Yup.string().required('Password is required'),
                newPassword2: Yup.string().oneOf(
                  [Yup.ref('newPassword1'), null],
                  'Passwords do not match'
                )
              })}
              onSubmit={(values) => {
                console.log(values);
              }}
            >
              {({ errors, isSubmitting, isValid, dirty }) => (
                <Form className='ui form'>
                  <MyTextInput
                    name='newPassword1'
                    type='password'
                    placeholder='New Password'
                  />
                  <MyTextInput
                    name='newPassword2'
                    type='password'
                    placeholder='Confirm Password'
                  />
                  {errors.auth && (
                    <Label
                      basic
                      color='red'
                      style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}
                      content={errors.auth}
                    />
                  )}
                  <Button
                    type='submit'
                    disabled={!isValid || !dirty || isSubmitting}
                    size='large'
                    positive
                    content='Update password'
                  />
                </Form>
              )}
            </Formik>
          </div>
          <div>
            <Header color='teal' sub content='Facebook account' />
            <p>Please visit Facebook to update your account</p>
            <Button
              icon='facebook'
              color='facebook'
              as={Link}
              to='https://facebook.com'
              content='Go to Facebook'
            />
          </div>
          <div>
            <Header color='teal' sub content='Google account' />
            <p>Please visit Google to update your account</p>
            <Button
              icon='google'
              color='google plus'
              as={Link}
              to='https://google.com'
              content='Go to Google'
            />
          </div>
        </Segment>
      );
    }
    ```
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import the AccountPage component: `import AccountPage from '../../features/auth/AccountPage';`
  - Create a route for the AccountPage component. Set the path to '/account'
    - `<Route path='/account' component={AccountPage} />`
- In SignedInMenu.jsx file:
  - Right after the 'My profile' Dropdown.Item, add a 'My account' Dropdown.Item
  - Make this dropdown as a link and set the pathname to '/account'
  - `<Dropdown.Item as={Link} to='/account' text='My account' icon='settings' />`

### [12. Adding additional user info into the authReducer](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/9cbd03d1187c9cc2acf44ad9489d3cc35b666f9d)
- In authReducer.js file:
  - In the SIGN_IN_USER case, add additional properties to the currentUser object
    ```javascript
		case SIGN_IN_USER:
			return {
				...state,
				authenticated: true,
				currentUser: {
					email: payload.email,
					photoURL: payload.photoURL,
					uid: payload.uid,
					displayName: payload.displayName,
					providerId: payload.providerData[0].providerId
				}
			};
    ```
- In SignedInMenu.jsx file:
  - Once the user is logged in, we want to display their displayName instead of their email address at the top NavBar
  - In the Dropdown component, change the text property to currentUser.displayName
    - `<Dropdown pointing='top left' text={currentUser.displayName}>`
- In AccountPage.jsx file:
  - Import useSelector() hook: `import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';`
  - Extract the currentUser property from authReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { currentUser } = useSelector((state) => state.auth);`
  - The currentUser.providerId property will tell which provider the user used to log into our application. It's either password, facebook, or google. We only want to display the relevant content based on the provider they used to login
  - In the render section:
    - Add conditional logic to display the proper content based on the provider the user used to login. Do this for all three providers
    - `{currentUser.providerId === 'password' && ( ... )`
    - `{currentUser.providerId === 'facebook.com' && ( ... )`
    - `{currentUser.providerId === 'google.com' && ( ... )`

### [13. Adding a password change function](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/e741125f0b77a52e10ce4714c9ec1f436cd054c5)
- In firebaseService.js file:
  - Write an updateUserPassword function that updates user password
    - This function takes creds as an argument. creds is the newPassword1 and newPassword2 values
    - First, we need to get a reference to our existing user. Assign it to a user variable
      - `const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;`
    - Then call the .updatePassword() on the user and pass in creds.newPassword1 as an argument. This returns a promise, so we need to use a loading indicator for this function
    ```javascript
    export function updateUserPassword(creds) {
      const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
      return user.updatePassword(creds.newPassword1);
    }
    ```
- In AccountPage.jsx file:
  - Import the updateUserPassword function: `import { updateUserPassword } from '../../app/firestore/firebaseService';`
  - In the onSubmit event handler:
    - Make the arrow function handler an async function by adding the 'async' keyword in front of it
    - As a 2nd arg, extract the setSubmitting and setErrors props, as an object, from Formik
    - Since this is an async function, run the code in a try/catch block
    - If there's an error, call the setErrors() method and set the auth property to error.message
    - In the try block:
      - Call the updateUserPassword() method and pass in values as an argument. Add the 'await' in front of it since we need to wait for this function to complete
      - Call setSubmitting() and set it to false. This will trigger the loading indicator
    ```javascript
    onSubmit={async (values, { setSubmitting, setErrors }) => {
      try {
        await updateUserPassword(values);
        setSubmitting(false);
      } catch (error) {
        setErrors({ auth: error.message });
        setSubmitting(false);
      }
    }}
    ```
  - In the 'Update password' Button element:
    - Add the loading property and make this button a block element
    ```javascript
    <Button
      style={{ display: 'block' }}
      loading={isSubmitting}
      type='submit'
      disabled={!isValid || !dirty || isSubmitting}
      size='large'
      positive
      content='Update password'
    />
    ```

### [14. Fixing our issue with app initialization](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/29ed8cca2b17432a848f702d32d65f8347c8f727)
- When a user is signed in and then visits the My Account page and then refreshes the page, we will run into an error that says Cannot read property 'providerId' of null. That is because we've initialized our app and the auth state is currently null and there's no user object. Certain page or component requires the user visiting the page be authenticated and we wrote a conditional somewhere in the component that is looking for the user object. ProviderId is one of the properties of the user object. When the Account page refreshes, it causes the component to re-render. And in the application initialization stage, it's looking for the providerId property but the currentUser object is currently null (no user object), so the application crashed
- So what we need to take a look at is our application initialization. Our components are going to attempt to display as soon as possible and we need to add some control into that and wait until certain things have loaded in our application before we attempt to display the components. At the moment, whether we're authenticated or not, there may be other information that we want to load in when we initialize our application before anything else loads up
- In our case, we're going to do this in the asyncReducer. We want to add an initialized flag into our asyncReducer and anything else that we need to do before our component renders
- In asyncReducer.js file:
  - Add another constant
    - `export const APP_LOADED = 'APP_LOADED';`
  - Add an additional initialState property of initialized and set it to false:
    ```javascript
    const initialState = {
      laoding: false,
      error: null,
      initialized: false
    };
    ```
  - Add another case to the asyncReducer function at the bottom
    - This function will return as an object, the existing state and set the initialized property to true
    ```javascript
		case APP_LOADED:
			return {
				...state,
				initialized: true
			};
    ```
- All of our initialization is taken place in the verifyAuth() action. We want to wait until we've got our current user before we can say our app is now loaded
- Go to authActions.js file:
  - Import the APP_LOADED constant: `import { APP_LOADED } from '../../app/async/asyncReducer';`
  - In the verifyAuth() function:
    - In this function, we're observing, listening for auth state to change. And we're going to get a user object back or not. If we do get a user, we dispatch the signInUser() action with the user object. This will set the state with the currentUser object
    - After this is done, we want to dispatch the APP_LOADED action. This is a flag. It's either true or false. When APP_LOADED is called, initialized state property is set to true
    - If there is no user, dispatch the signOutUser() action and then dispatch the APP_LOADED action. The initialized state property is not set to true after we signed out user
    ```javascript
    export function verifyAuth() {
      return function (dispatch) {
        return firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
          if (user) {
            // Update the state with currentUser object
            dispatch(signInUser(user));
            dispatch({ type: APP_LOADED });
          } else {
            dispatch(signOutUser());
            dispatch({ type: APP_LOADED });
          }
        });
      };
    }
    ```
- Next is, we want to prevent our application component from loading until the APP_LOADED flag is set to true. And we'll do this at the root of our component
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import useSelector() hook: `import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';`
  - Import LoadingComponent component: `import LoadingComponent from './LoadingComponent';`
  - Get the initialized property from the asyncReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { initialized } = useSelector((state) => state.async);`
  - Write an if statement to see if initialized property is false. If it is, return the LoadingComponent component. What this means is, we don't attempt to load any of our application until the initialized flag is set to true and by that point, we should have our currentUser object
    - `if (!initialized) return <LoadingComponent content='Loading app...' />;`
- In SignedInMenu.jsx file:
  - When the user clicks the 'Sign out' Dropdown.Item, the handleSignOut() method is executed. We want to push the user to the homepage first, then call the signOutFirebase() method to sign them out in Firebase
    ```javascript
    async function handleSignOut() {
      try {
        history.push('/');
        await signOutFirebase();
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error(error.message);
      }
    }
    ```


## USER PROFILES

### [1. Adding a profile page: ProfilePage and ProfileHeader components](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/0e67c6085a797b3819cb90a5cf691479daa44668)
- In src/features/profiles/profilePage folder, create a component/file called ProfilePage.jsx
- In ProfilePage.jsx file:

    ```javascript
    export default function ProfilePage() {
      return (

  - Write a ProfileHeader functional component that renders 
    - a 12-width column grid of the user profile picture and display name
    - a 4-width column grid of the user's statistics of number of following and followers
    ```javascript
    export default function ProfileHeader() {
      return (
        <Segment>
          <Grid>
            <Grid.Column width={12}>
              <Item.Group>
                <Item>

                      content='Display name'
                    />
                  </Item.Content>
                </Item>
              </Item.Group>
            </Grid.Column>
            <Grid.Column width={4}>
              <Statistic.Group>
                <Statistic label='Followers' value={10} />
                <Statistic label='Following' value={5} />
              </Statistic.Group>
              <Divider />
              <Reveal animated='move'>
                <Reveal.Content visible style={{ width: '100%' }}>
                  <Button fluid color='teal' content='Following' />
                </Reveal.Content>
                <Reveal.Content hidden style={{ width: '100%' }}>
                  <Button basic fluid color='red' content='Unfollow' />
                </Reveal.Content>
              </Reveal>
            </Grid.Column>
          </Grid>
        </Segment>
      );
    }
    ```
- Setup a link so that we can visit the ProfilePage
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import the ProfilePage component: `import ProfilePage from '../../features/profiles/profilePage/ProfilePage';`
  - Create a route for the ProfilePage component right after the route for AccountPage
    - The path contains the user id
    - `<Route path='/profile/:id' component={ProfilePage} />`
- In SignedInMenu.jsx file:
  - In the jsx section:
    - Make the 'My profile' Dropdown.Item component as a Link and specify the pathname
    ```javascript
    <Dropdown.Item
      as={Link}
      to={`/profile/${currentUser?.uid}`}
      text='My profile'
      icon='user'
    />
    ```

### [2. Adding the profile content: ProfileContent component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/6db94425bed1b19877597d23cda493de0709bc48)
- In features/profiles/profilePage folder, create a component/file called ProfileContent.jsx
- In ProfileContent.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic Tab component: `import { Tab } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write a ProfileContent functional component that renders the user profile content
    ```javascript
    export default function ProfileContent() {
      const panes = [
        { menuItem: 'About', render: () => <Tab.Pane>About User</Tab.Pane> },
        { menuItem: 'Photos', render: () => <Tab.Pane>Photos</Tab.Pane> },
        { menuItem: 'Events', render: () => <Tab.Pane>Events</Tab.Pane> },
        { menuItem: 'Followers', render: () => <Tab.Pane>Followers</Tab.Pane> },
        { menuItem: 'Following', render: () => <Tab.Pane>Following</Tab.Pane> }
      ];

      return (
        <Tab
          menu={{ fluid: true, vertical: true }}
          menuPosition='right'
          panes={panes}
        />
      );
    }
    ```
- In ProfilePage.jsx file:
  - Import the ProfileContent component: `import ProfileContent from './ProfileContent';`
    - In jsx, instantiate the ProfileContent component right after the ProfileHeader component: `<ProfileContent />`

### [3. Creating the redux actions](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/03b38de54bb60fd72ce5a981617b840fa3c0542f)
- In src/features/profiles folder, create a file called profileConstants.js
- In profileConstants.js file:
  - Add a constant LISTEN_TO_CURRENT_USER_PROFILE action
  - This is something we want to listen to, especially when we initialize our application. We want to get the currentUser profile from Firestore and populate that in our Redux store and continuously listen to the current user profile as well
    - `export const LISTEN_TO_CURRENT_USER_PROFILE = 'LISTEN_TO_CURRENT_USER_PROFILE';`
- In src/features/profiles folder, create a file called profileActions.js
- In profileActions.js file:
  - Import the constant: `import { LISTEN_TO_CURRENT_USER_PROFILE } from "./profileConstants";`
  - Write a listenToCurrentUserProfile action creator function that gets the current user profile from Firestore
    - This function takes a profile as an argument
    - This function returns as an object,
      - the action type of LISTEN_TO_CURRENT_USER_PROFILE
      - the payload of profile
    ```javascript
    export function listenToCurrentUserProfile(profile) {
      return {
        type: LISTEN_TO_CURRENT_USER_PROFILE,
        payload: profile
      };
    }
    ```
- In src/features/profiles folder, create a file called profileReducer.js
- In profileReducer.js file:
  - Import the constant: `import { LISTEN_TO_CURRENT_USER_PROFILE } from './profileConstants';`
  - Create an initialState object
    ```javascript
    const initialState = {
      currentUserProfile: null
    };
    ```
  - Write a profileReducer function
    - This function takes 2 arguments
      - 1st arg is the state and it is set to initialState as default value
      - 2nd arg is the action, destructuring the type and payload properties
    - Use a switch statement to handle different action types
    - Write a case for the LISTEN_TO_CURRENT_USER_PROFILE action type
      - This action returns as an object, the existing state and the currentUserProfile state property of payload
      - When this action is dispatched, currentUserProfile property in the profileReducer redux store will contain current user profile from Firestore
    - Write a default case that returns the state
    ```javascript
    export default function profileReducer(
      state = initialState,
      { type, payload }
    ) {
      switch (type) {
        case LISTEN_TO_CURRENT_USER_PROFILE:
          return {
            ...state,
            currentUserProfile: payload
          };
        default: {
          return state;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
- In rootReducer.js file:
  - Import the profileReducer: `import profileReducer from '../../features/profiles/profileReducer';`
  - Add the profileReducer as profile property to the rootReducer
    - `profile: profileReducer`
- We can go to the Redux devTools console and check out our Redux state and we should be able to find a new profile state with a currentUserProfile property in it. The currentUserProfile is currently null, but we can hook up our ProfilePage to Firestore and get the user profile data down so we can display it in the page

### [4. Connecting the ProfilePage to the store](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/7eb7cfc1ff2e33451de4f277975ddb99ca17331c)
- In ProfilePage.jsx file:
  - Import useDispatch() and useSelector() hooks: `import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';`
  - Create a dispatch() method using useDispatch() hook
    - `const dispatch = useDispatch();`
  - Extract the currentUserProfile property from profileReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { currentUserProfile } = useSelector((state) => state.profile);`
  - Extract the loading and error properties from asyncReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { loading, error } = useSelector((state) => state.async);`
- Next, we want to get the user profile document from Firestore
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Write a getUserProfile query function that gets user profile from Firestore
    - This function takes userId as an argument
    ```javascript
    export function getUserProfile(userId) {
      return db.collection('users').doc(userId);
    }
    ```
- In ProfilePage.jsx file:
  - We will use the custom useFirestoreDoc() hook to get the user document from fire
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import { getUserProfile } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';
    import useFirestoreDoc from '../../../app/hooks/useFirestoreDoc';
    import { listenToCurrentUserProfile } from '../profileActions';
    import LoadingComponent from '../../../app/layout/LoadingComponent';
    ```
  - In the ProfilePage component, destructure the match props. We want to use the match.params to get the userId from the route params
    - `export default function ProfilePage({ match }) { ... }`
  - Use the custom useFirestoreDoc() hook:
    - This hook accepts query, data, deps, and shouldExecute object as an argument
    - For query props, call the getUserProfile() method inside an arrow function and pass in the match.params.id, which is the userId
      - This will return the user data from Firestore
    - For data props: dispatch the listenToCurrentUserProfile() action inside an arrow function and pass in the profile as an argument. The arrow function receives profile as props
      - Once we have the data, we dispatch the listenToCurrentUserProfile() action to store the data/profile in Redux store
      - The data/profile is stored in the currentUserProfile property in the profileReducer
    - For deps props, which is an array: list dispatch and match.params.id as dependencies
      - This component will only re-renders when there's a change in dispatch or the userId
    ```javascript
    useFirestoreDoc({
      query: () => getUserProfile(match.params.id),
      data: (profile) => dispatch(listenToCurrentUserProfile(profile)),
      deps: [dispatch, match.params.id]
    });
    ```
  - Write an if statement to check if loading is true AND no currentUserProfile or no currentUserProfile AND no error. If the condition is true, then return the LoadingComponent component
    ```javascript
    if ((loading && !currentUserProfile) || (!currentUserProfile && !error))
      return <LoadingComponent content='Loading profile...' />;
    ```
  - Pass down the currentUserProfile object as profile props to both ProfileHeader and ProfileContent child components
    ```javascript
    <ProfileHeader profile={currentUserProfile} />
    <ProfileContent profile={currentUserProfile} />
    ```
- In ProfileHeader.jsx file:
  - Accept profile as props from ProfilePage parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function ProfileHeader({ profile }) { ... }`
  - Then set the source image to display the profile photoURL or a static profile image if they don't have one
    - `src={profile.photoURL || '/assets/user.png'}`
  - Set the Header content to display the profile displayName
    - `content={profile.displayName}`

### [5. Adding an about page: AboutTab component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/69218be2b3b063969a70cdd8794e7bc059251eec)
- In features/profiles/profilePage folder, create a component/file called AboutTab.jsx
- In AboutTab.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    import { Button, Grid, Header, Tab } from 'semantic-ui-react';
    import { format } from 'date-fns';
    ```
  - Write an AboutTab functional component that renders the about tab
    - Receives profile as props from ProfileContent parent component
    - Create an editMode state using useState() hook and set its initial value to false
      - The reason why we have the editMode state is the user could edit this page if they like. If it's in editMode, we want to display a form to the user. Else, we want to display the about content
      - `const [editMode, setEditMode] = useState(false);`
    - There's a button that toggles between 'Cancel' or 'Edit', depending on the editMode state
    - The content is wrapped in a `<Tab.Pane />` component. So when a user clicks on the About tab on the right column, the About content is displayed in a pane on the left column
    ```javascript
    export default function AboutTab({ profile }) {
      const [editMode, setEditMode] = useState(false);

      return (
        <Tab.Pane>
          <Grid>
            <Grid.Column width={16}>
              <Header
                floated='left'
                icon='user'
                content={`About ${profile.displayName}`}
              />
              <Button
                onClick={() => setEditMode(!editMode)}
                floated='right'
                basic
                content={editMode ? 'Cancel' : 'Edit'}
              />
            </Grid.Column>
            <Grid.Column width={16}>
              {editMode ? (
                <p>Profile form</p>
              ) : (
                <>
                  <div style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}>
                    <strong>
                      Member since: {format(profile.createdAt, 'dd MMM yyyy')}
                    </strong>
                    <div>{profile.description || null}</div>
                  </div>
                </>
              )}
            </Grid.Column>
          </Grid>
        </Tab.Pane>
      );
    }
    ```
- In ProfileContent.jsx file:
  - Import the AboutTab component: `import AboutTab from './AboutTab';`
  - The ProfileContent component receives profile as props from ProfilePage parent component. Destructure profile
    - `export default function ProfileContent({ profile }) { ... }`
  - Inside the 'About' menuItem:
    - Instantiate the AboutTab component inside the arrow function of the render property
    - Then pass down the profile props to the AboutTab child component
    - `{ menuItem: 'About', render: () => <AboutTab profile={profile} /> }`

### [6. Adding the profile form: ProfileForm component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/0d3d53db637540b38a2d0672028cab977aeb7eb2)
- In features/profiles/profilePage folder, create a component/file called ProfileForm.jsx
- In ProfileForm.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { Form, Formik } from 'formik';
    import MyTextInput from '../../../app/common/form/MyTextInput';
    import MyTextArea from '../../../app/common/form/MyTextArea';
    import { Button } from 'semantic-ui-react';
    import * as Yup from 'yup';
    ```
  - Write a ProfileForm functional component that renders a profile form using Formik
    - This component receives profile props from AboutTab parent component
    - Use Formik to create the form
      - Provide the initialValues object
      - Add validationSchema property to validate the input field
      - Console log the values for onSubmit event handler for now
    - Render the Form component inside the render props
      - Extracts the isSubmitting, isValid, and dirty props as an argument
    ```javascript
    export default function ProfileForm({ profile }) {
      return (
        <Formik
          initialValues={{
            displayName: profile.displayName,
            description: profile.description || ''
          }}
          validationSchema={Yup.object({
            displayName: Yup.string().required()
          })}
          onSubmit={(values) => console.log(values)}
        >
          {({ isSubmitting, isValid, dirty }) => (
            <Form className='ui form'>
              <MyTextInput name='displayName' placeholder='Display Name' />
              <MyTextArea name='description' placeholder='Description' />
              <Button
                loading={isSubmitting}
                disabled={isSubmitting || !isValid || !dirty}
                floated='right'
                type='submit'
                size='large'
                positive
                content='Update profile'
              />
            </Form>
          )}
        </Formik>
      );
    }
    ```
- In AboutTab.jsx file:
  - Import the ProfileForm component: `import ProfileForm from './ProfileForm';`
  - In the editMode conditional logic, render the ProfileForm component if editMode state is true
    - Pass down the profile props to the ProfileForm child component
    - `{editMode ? ( <ProfileForm profile={profile} /> ) : ( ... )}`
					
### [7. Adding the update user actions](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/504a233fd8470cd1f65e474687949a5dfa0126ce)
- When the 'Update profile' button is clicked, we want to update the user profile in Firebase auth and in the user document in Firestore users collection. And since we're listening to Firebase user profile, the profileReducer in Redux store will receive the update and then the update is display in the page
- To get this done, we want to check if the currentUser object in the authReducer has a differently displayName. If it does, then we want to update the firebase.auth().currentUser profile in the Firebase using the .updateProfile() method. We also want to update the user profile document in Firestore users collection
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Write an async updateUserProfile function that updates the user profile in Firebase auth and Firestore user document
    - This function accepts profile as an argument
    - First, get the currentUser from firebase.auth() and assign it to a user variable
    - Then use a try/catch block to write the conditional
    - If there's an error, throw the error back to the form
    - In the try block:
      - Write an if statement to check if the user's displayName in Firebase is different from the given profile's displayName
        - If it is, call the .updateProfile() method on the user variable and we want to set the displayName property to the displayName of the given profile. This is an async operation, so add the 'await' keyword in front of it
        - This will update the displayName property of the currentUser in Firebase auth
      - Once the above is completed, we want to make another async operation to update the user document in Firestore in the users collection by using the .update() method and pass in profile as an argument
        - Do this outside of the if statement
        - Add the 'await' keyword in front of it since we need to wait for this to complete
        - Lastly, add the return to this operation because we want to use this data that is returned later
    ```javascript
    export async function updateUserProfile(profile) {
      const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
      try {
        if (user.displayName !== profile.displayName) {
          await user.updateProfile({
            displayName: profile.displayName
          });
        }
        return await db.collection('users').doc(user.uid).update(profile);
      } catch (error) {
        throw error;
      }
    }
    ```
- In ProfileForm.jsx file:
  - When the 'Update profile' button is clicked, the onSubmit event handler will call the updateUserProfile() function asynchronously and takes in the given values to update the user profile 
  - Import the updateUserProfile function: `import { updateUserProfile } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';`
  - Import toast: `import { toast } from 'react-toastify';`
  - In the onSubmit event handler:
    - Turn the arrow function event handler into an async/await function since the function it's going to call we must wait for it to complete. Add the 'async' keyword in front of the arrow function
    - This arrow function receives the values and the setSubmitting props as arguments
    - Inside the arrow function, use a try/catch block to run the async code
    - If there's an error, call the toast.error() method to display a notification of the error.message from Firestore
    - In the try block:
      - Call the updateUserProfile() method and pass in the values as an argument. Add an 'await' in front of it as we must wait for this operation to complete
    - Finally, use the setSubmitting() method and set it to false. This will turn off the loading indicator
    ```javascript
    onSubmit={async (values, { setSubmitting }) => {
      try {
        await updateUserProfile(values);
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error(error.message);
      } finally {
        setSubmitting(false);
      }
    }}
    ```
 
### [8. Initializing the app with the current user profile](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/5e319c671a7039073c448dd081f6f977492bfc23)
- Once a user is successfully logged in, the user profile displayed in the NavBar on the right hand side is currently populated from the authReducer. It's listening to state change in Firebase.auth. If the user updates their displayName, they would have to refresh the ProfilePage to see the updated change. Instead, we want this to listen to the currentUserProfile profileReducer in Firestore and update the change from there
- We will need to create another action and another state for the profileReducer
- In profileConstants.js file:
  - Create another constant for LISTEN_TO_SELECTED_USER_PROFILE
  - `export const LISTEN_TO_SELECTED_USER_PROFILE = 'LISTEN_TO_SELECTED_USER_PROFILE';`
- In profileActions.js file:
  - Import the constant: `import { LISTEN_TO_SELECTED_USER_PROFILE } from "./profileConstants";`
  - Write a listenToSelectedUserProfile action creator function that gets the selected user profile from Firestore
    - This function takes a profile as an argument
    - This function returns as an object,
      - the action type of LISTEN_TO_SELECTED_USER_PROFILE
      - the payload of profile
    ```javascript
    export function listenToSelectedUserProfile(profile) {
      return {
        type: LISTEN_TO_SELECTED_USER_PROFILE,
        payload: profile
      };
    }
    ```
- In profileReducer.js file:
  - Import the constant: `import { LISTEN_TO_SELECTED_USER_PROFILE } from './profileConstants';`
  - In the initialState object, add a selectedUserProfile property and set it to null
    ```javascript
    const initialState = {
      currentUserProfile: null,
      selectedUserProfile: null
    };
    ```
  - In the profileReducer function:
    - Add another case in the switch statement for LISTEN_TO_SELECTED_USER_PROFILE action type
      - This action returns as an object, the existing state and the selectedUserProfile state property of payload
      - When this action is dispatched, selectedUserProfile property in the profileReducer redux store will contain the selected user profile from Firestore
    ```javascript
    case LISTEN_TO_SELECTED_USER_PROFILE:
      return {
        ...state,
        selectedUserProfile: payload
      };
    ```
- In the SignedInMenu.jsx file:
  - What we currently doing to display the current user in the NavBar is we're getting this from the authReducer `(state => state.auth)`. Instead, we want to get the currentUserProfile property from the profileReducer
    - `const { currentUserProfile } = useSelector((state) => state.profile);`
  - Then in JSX, we want to get the user profile image from currentUserProfile property state
    ```javascript
    <Image
      avatar
      spaced='right'
      src={currentUserProfile?.photoURL || '/assets/user.png'}
    />
    ```
  - Also the user profile displayName from currentUserProfile property state
    - `<Dropdown pointing='top left' text={currentUserProfile.displayName}>`
  - And the Link path to 'My Profile' page
    ```javascript
    <Dropdown.Item
      as={Link}
      to={`/profile/${currentUserProfile?.id}`}
      text='My profile'
      icon='user'
    />
    ```
- Now our code is broken. Before we display anything to the user, we need to verify whether they're logged in or not and respond accordingly
- In authActions.js file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import { dataFromSnapshot, getUserProfile } from '../../app/firestore/firestoreService';
    import { listenToCurrentUserProfile } from '../../features/profiles/profileActions';
    ```
  - Inside the verifyAuth() function:
    - After we dispatched the signInUser() action, we want to call the getUserProfile() function from firestoreService and pass in the user.uid to get the user document in Firestore users collection. Assign the returned user document to profileRef variable
    - Then call the .onSnapshot() method on profileRef to get the snapshot, which contains the user profile data
    - Once we have the snapshot, use a callback function to 
      - dispatch the listenToCurrentUserProfile() action and pass in the dataFromSnapshot() method with the snapshot as an argument. The dataFromSnapshot() method shapes the snapshot into a usable format before handing the profile data to the listenToCurrentUserProfile() action. The listenToCurrentUserProfile() action will take this profile data and store it currentUserProfile property in profileReducer store
      - After we received the snapshot, we know that our app is safe to be loaded. So inside the callback function, dispatch the APP_LOADED action
    ```javascript
    export function verifyAuth() {
      return function (dispatch) {
        return firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
          if (user) {
            // Update the state with currentUser object
            dispatch(signInUser(user));
            const profileRef = getUserProfile(user.uid);
            profileRef.onSnapshot((snapshot) => {
              dispatch(listenToCurrentUserProfile(dataFromSnapshot(snapshot)));
              dispatch({ type: APP_LOADED });
            });
          } else {
            dispatch(signOutUser());
            dispatch({ type: APP_LOADED });
          }
        });
      };
    }
    ```
- Now when the user updates their displayName in the 'Update profile' form, it'll update the current user displayName in the NavBar as well

### [9. Selecting other user profiles](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/e0516493ffe64b06e5cf4f56e5e7911a6f3467a8)
- When a user visits another user's profile page we want to show or hide certain data depending on whether they're the currently logged in user. For example, we don't want a user have access to the 'Edit/Cancel' button to edit a profile if they're are not the current user of this profile page. Or make the 'Follow' button available if the current logged in user visits their own profile page. We can find out the current logged in user with their uid in the currentUser property in the authReducer
- In ProfilePage.jsx file:
  - Import the listenToSelectedUserProfile() action: `import { listenToSelectedUserProfile } from '../profileActions';`
  - Extract the selectedUserProfile property from profileReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { selectedUserProfile } = useSelector((state) => state.profile);`
  - Extract the currentUser property from authReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { currentUser } = useSelector((state) => state.auth);`
  - In the useFirestoreDoc() custom hook:
    - Instead of listening to the listenToCurrentUserProfile() action, we want to listen to the listenToSelectionUserProfile() action. This will store the profile data in the selectedUserProfile property of the profileReducer state
    ```javascript
    useFirestoreDoc({
      query: () => getUserProfile(match.params.id),
      data: (profile) => dispatch(listenToSelectedUserProfile(profile)),
      deps: [dispatch, match.params.id]
    });
    ```
  - Then swap all of the currentUserProfile properties to use selectedUserProfile properties instead
  - Pass down the selectedUserProfile as profile props to both ProfileHeader and ProfileContent child components
    ```javascript
    <ProfileHeader profile={selectedUserProfile} />
    <ProfileContent profile={selectedUserProfile} />
    ```
  - Next thing is we want to check if the profile we're looking at is the currentUser. Write a condition that checks that the currentUser.uid is equal to the selectedUserProfile.id. If it is, assign it to isCurrentUser props that's being passed down to the ProfileHeader and ProfileContent child components
    ```javascript
    <ProfileHeader
      profile={selectedUserProfile}
      isCurrentUser={currentUser.uid === selectedUserProfile.id}
    />
    <ProfileContent
      profile={selectedUserProfile}
      isCurrentUser={currentUser.uid === selectedUserProfile.id}
    />
    ```
- In ProfileHeader.jsx file:
  - Receive the isCurrentUser props from the ProfilePage parent component and destructure it
  - In JSX, we only want to display/reveal the 'Following' button in the ProfileHeader section if the user is NOT the currentUser. This prevents them from following themselves. If they're visiting someone else's ProfilePage, then they're not the isCurrentUser of this page and they would see the 'Following' button and they can follow this particular user
    ```javascript
    {!isCurrentUser && (
      <>
        <Divider />
        <Reveal animated='move'>
          <Reveal.Content visible style={{ width: '100%' }}>
            <Button fluid color='teal' content='Following' />
          </Reveal.Content>
          <Reveal.Content hidden style={{ width: '100%' }}>
            <Button basic fluid color='red' content='Unfollow' />
          </Reveal.Content>
        </Reveal>
      </>
    )}
    ```
- In ProfileContent.jsx file:
  - Receive the isCurrentUser props from the ProfilePage parent component and destructure it
  - Pass down the isCurrentUser props to the AboutTab child component
    ```javascript
		{
			menuItem: 'About',
			render: () => <AboutTab profile={profile} isCurrentUser={isCurrentUser} />
		},
    ```
- In AboutTab.jsx file:
  - Receive the isCurrentUser props from the ProfileContent parent component and destructure it
  - In JSX, we only want the isCurrentUser to be able to edit their own profile. Write a condition to check if the user is a current user. If they are, then display the 'Cancel/Edit' button
    ```javascript
    {isCurrentUser && (
      <Button
        onClick={() => setEditMode(!editMode)}
        floated='right'
        basic
        content={editMode ? 'Cancel' : 'Edit'}
      />
    )}
    ```


## IMAGE UPLOAD
- Storage with FirebaseStorage
- Adding images with dropzone
- Image resizing with Cropper.js
- Allowing users to update their main photo
- Users should be able to:
  - Upload new photos
  - Set a photo as their main photo
  - Delete a photo

### [1. Adding a profile photos page: PhotosTab component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/27805ae5bae024401cec9caf6dc4c183a2a3635e)
- In src/features/profiles/profilePage folder, create a component/file called PhotosTab.jsx
- In PhotosTab.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React, { useState } from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic UI components: `import { Button, Card, Grid, Header, Image, Tab } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - This component very similar page layout and functionality as the AboutTab component. Copy and paste the code as a starter
  - Write a PhotosTab functional component that renders a profile photos tab using Semantic UI
    ```javascript
    export default function PhotosTab({ profile, isCurrentUser }) {
      const [editMode, setEditMode] = useState(false);

      return (
        <Tab.Pane>
          <Grid>
            <Grid.Column width={16}>
              <Header floated='left' icon='user' content={`Photos`} />
              {isCurrentUser && (
                <Button
                  onClick={() => setEditMode(!editMode)}
                  floated='right'
                  basic
                  content={editMode ? 'Cancel' : 'Add Photo'}
                />
              )}
            </Grid.Column>
            <Grid.Column width={16}>
              {editMode ? (
                <p>Photo widget will go here</p>
              ) : (
                <Card.Group itemsPerRow={5}>
                  <Card>
                    <Image src='/assets/user.png' />
                    <Button.Group fluid width={2}>
                      <Button basic color='green' content='Main' />
                      <Button basic color='red' icon='trash' />
                    </Button.Group>
                  </Card>
                </Card.Group>
              )}
            </Grid.Column>
          </Grid>
        </Tab.Pane>
      );
    }
    ```
- In ProfileContent.jsx file:
  - Import the PhotosTab component: `import PhotosTab from './PhotosTab';`
  - Inside the 'Photos' menuItem panes:
    - Instantiate the PhotosTab component inside the arrow function of the render property
    - Then pass down the profile and isCurrentUser props to the PhotosTab child component
    ```javascript
		{
			menuItem: 'Photos',
			render: () => <PhotosTab profile={profile} isCurrentUser={isCurrentUser} />
		},
    ```

### [2. Adding a photo upload widget: PhotoUploadWidget component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/bef10054b30f581a90f6ca1147ef8aa40da8daa0)
- In src/app/common/photos folder, create a component/file called PhotoUploadWidget.jsx
- In PhotoUploadWidget.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic UI components: `import { Grid, Header } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write a PhotoUploadWidget functional component creates a structure for the photo upload widget using Semantic UI
    ```javascript
    export default function PhotoUploadWidget() {
      return (
        <Grid>
          <Grid.Column width={4}>
            <Header color='teal' sub content='Step 1 - Add Photo' />
          </Grid.Column>
          <Grid.Column width={1} />

          <Grid.Column width={4}>
            <Header color='teal' sub content='Step 2 - Resize' />
          </Grid.Column>
          <Grid.Column width={1} />

          <Grid.Column width={4}>
            <Header color='teal' sub content='Step 3 - Preview & Upload' />
          </Grid.Column>
        </Grid>
      );
    }
    ```
- In PhotosTab.jsx file:
  - Import the PhotoUploadWidget component: `import PhotoUploadWidget from '../../../app/common/photos/PhotoUploadWidget';`
  - In JSX, right where the editMode is true, render the PhotoUploadWidget component
    - `{editMode ? ( <PhotoUploadWidget /> ) : ( ... )}`
					
### [3. React-dropzone: PhotoWidgetDropzone component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/5459f5e3bd160f368f8c37be3cd8ce09260b2aa2)
- React-dropzone source: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dropzone
- Install react-dropzone library: `npm i react-dropzone`
- In src/app/common/photos folder, create a component/file called PhotoWidgetDropzone.jsx
- In PhotoWidgetDropzone.jsx file:
  - Copy and paste the example demo code from the npm website
    ```javascript
    import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
    import { useDropzone } from 'react-dropzone';

    export default function PhotoWidgetDropzone() {
      const onDrop = useCallback((acceptedFiles) => {
        console.log(acceptedFiles)
      }, []);
      const { getRootProps, getInputProps, isDragActive } = useDropzone({ onDrop });

      return (
        <div {...getRootProps()}>
          <input {...getInputProps()} />
          {isDragActive ? (
            <p>Drop the files here ...</p>
          ) : (
            <p>Drag 'n' drop some files here, or click to select files</p>
          )}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
- In PhotoUploadWidget.jsx file:
  - Import the PhotoWidgetDropzone component: `import PhotoWidgetDropzone from './PhotoWidgetDropzone';`
  - Right after the Header component, instantiate the PhotoWidgetDropzone component
    - `<PhotoWidgetDropzone />`
- We should now be able to click on the widget to add a file or drag-n-drop a file to the widget. In the console, we can see the file being uploaded. Next thing we want to do is add styling to the widget
- In PhotoWidgetDropzone.jsx file:
  - Create a dropzoneStyles object and specify the style in there
    ```javascript
    const dropzoneStyles = {
      border: 'dashed 3px #eee',
      borderRadius: '5%',
      paddingTop: '30px',
      textAlign: 'center'
    };
    ```
  - Create a dropzoneActive object to add styles when the dropzone is active
    ```javascript
    const dropzoneActive = {
      border: 'dashed 3px green'
    };
    ```
- In PhotoUploadWidget.jsx file:
  - Import useState() hook: `import React, { useState } from 'react';`
  - Create a files state using useState() hook and initialize its value to an empty array
    - `const [files, setFiles] = useState([]);`
  - Pass down the setFiles method as props to the PhotoWidgetDropzone child component
    - `<PhotoWidgetDropzone setFiles={setFiles} />`
- In PhotoWidgetDropzone.jsx file:
  - Receive the setFiles props from the PhotoUploadWidget parent component and destructure it
  - Once we have the files/acceptedFiles array, we want to map over the array to get each file image and call setFiles() method to set the file in files state. We also want to set a property on the file so we can see a preview of the image
  - Inside the useCallback() hook:
    - This hook takes an arrow function as 1st arg and a dependencies array as 2nd arg
    - In the arrow function:
      - It accepts the acceptedFiles as an argument
      - Call the setFiles() method and pass in the acceptFiles
      - Map over the acceptedFiles to access the individual file using .map() method
      - For each file, call the Object.assign() method and pass in the file as the 1st argument. The 2nd argument is an object to set a preview property of `URL.createObjectURL(file)`. This will give us the ability to preview the image
    - As for the 2nd arg, list setFiles as a dependency in the dependencies array. Whenever there's a change in setFiles, it causes the component to re-render
    ```javascript
    const onDrop = useCallback(
      (acceptedFiles) => {
        // console.log(acceptedFiles);
        setFiles(
          acceptedFiles.map((file) =>
            Object.assign(file, {
              preview: URL.createObjectURL(file)
            })
          )
        );
      },
      [setFiles]
    );
    ```
  - Then in JSX:
    - Apply styles to the widget depending on the isDragActive
    - Also add an upload icon and a Header text
    ```javascript
    return (
      <div {...getRootProps()} style={isDragActive ? {...dropzoneStyles, ...dropzoneActive} : dropzoneStyles}>
        <input {...getInputProps()} />
        <Icon name='upload' size='huge' />
        <Header content='Drop image here' />
      </div>
    );
    ```
- Now when we drag an image file to the dropzone widget, the border should turn green. When it's not active, it should have a grey dashed border. Also, the files state of the PhotoUploadWidget component should contain the image file we just uploaded

### [4. React-cropper: PhotoWidgetCropper component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/91afa24984ff09251b4fe254585d8fe968c0a2b8)
- After the user uploaded an image, we want them to be able to crop the image using the react-cropper library
- React-cropper source: https://github.com/react-cropper/react-cropper
- Install react-cropper library: `npm i react-cropper`
- In src/app/common/photos folder, create a component/file called PhotoWidgetCropper.jsx
- In PhotoWidgetCropper.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import React, { useRef } from "react";
    import Cropper from "react-cropper";
    import "cropperjs/dist/cropper.css";
    ```
  - Create a PhotoWidgetCropper functional component
    - Copy and paste the example demo code from the github website as a starter
    - Create a cropperRef using the useRef() hook and initialize its value to null. cropperRef is now a ref to an element on our page
      - `const cropperRef = useRef(null);`
      - `useRef` returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument (`initialValue`). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component
    - Write a cropImage function
      - First, check to see if there is a cropper element that we can call the .getCroppedCanvas() method on. If there isn't (undefined), return early
      - If there is a cropper element, we want to call a setImage() function, but we need to create this function in the parent component, which is the PhotoUploadWidget component
    ```javascript
    export default function PhotoWidgetCropper() {
      const cropperRef = useRef(null);

      function cropImage() {
        const imageElement = cropperRef?.current;
        const cropper = imageElement?.cropper;

        if (typeof cropper.getCroppedCanvas() === 'undefined') {
          return;
        }
        cropper.getCroppedCanvas().toBlob((blob) => {
          // setImage() function goes here
        });
      }

      return (
        <Cropper
          src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roadmanfong/react-cropper/master/example/img/child.jpg"
          style={{ height: 400, width: "100%" }}
          // Cropper.js options
          initialAspectRatio={16 / 9}
          guides={false}
          crop={onCrop}
          ref={cropper}
        />
      );
    };
    ```
- In PhotoUploadWidget.jsx file:
  - Import the PhotoWidgetCropper component: `import PhotoWidgetCropper from './PhotoWidgetCropper';`
  - Create an image state using useState() hook and initialize its value to null
    - `const [image, setImage] = useState(null);`
  - In JSX:
    - Inside the 2nd Grid.Column and after the Header element, instantiate the PhotoWidgetCropper component
      - Then pass down the setImage method as props to the PhotoWidgetCropper child component
      - Also pass down the imagePreview props to the PhotoWidgetCropper child component. This props is the files state of the first element of the files array and the preview property that we created in the PhotoWidgetDropzone component
      - `<PhotoWidgetCropper setImage={setImage} imagePreview={files[0].preview} />`
    - We also want to write a condition to make sure that there is at least one file in the files state array before we display the PhotoWidgetCropper component
      ```javascript
			<Grid.Column width={4}>
				<Header color='teal' sub content='Step 2 - Resize' />
				{files.length > 0 && (
					<PhotoWidgetCropper
						setImage={setImage}
						imagePreview={files[0].preview}
					/>
				)}
			</Grid.Column>
      ```
- In PhotoWidgetCropper.jsx file:
  - Receive the setImage and imagePreview props from the PhotoUploadWidget component and destructure it
  - In the cropImage() function:
    - Inside the .toBlob() callback function, call the setImage() method to set the blob
    - Then as a 2nd arg of the .toBlob() method, we need specify the type of blob it's going to be. In this case, it's an image/jpeg type
  - After that we need to specify the properties for the Cropper wrapper component in JSX
    - Note that the preview property is set a className. We will use this className in a div tag in the PhotoUploadWidget component to display the image preview
    - The initialAspectRatio property is set to 1. This will crop a square image
    - The src property is set to imagePreview, which is a props from the parent component. imagePreview is the file in the files state
  - Final code for the component:
    ```javascript
    export default function PhotoWidgetCropper({ setImage, imagePreview }) {
      const cropperRef = useRef(null);

      function cropImage() {
        const imageElement = cropperRef?.current;
        const cropper = imageElement?.cropper;

        if (typeof cropper.getCroppedCanvas() === 'undefined') {
          return;
        }
        cropper.getCroppedCanvas().toBlob((blob) => {
          setImage(blob);
        }, 'image/jpeg');
      }

      return (
        <Cropper
          ref={cropperRef}
          src={imagePreview}
          style={{ height: 200, width: '100%' }}
          // Cropper.js options
          initialAspectRatio={1}
          preview='.img-preview'
          guides={false}
          viewMode={1}
          dragMode='move'
          scalable={true}
          cropBoxMovable={true}
          cropBoxResizable={true}
          crop={cropImage}
        />
      );
    }
    ```
- In PhotoUploadWidget.jsx file:
  - In JSX, inside the 3rd Grid.Column: 
    - We first want to check if there exists at least one file in the files state. If there is, we want to display the image preview and two buttons underneath it
    - Wrap the two Buttons in a Button.Group wrapper. This way, the buttons will be next to each other
    ```javascript
    <Grid.Column width={4}>
      <Header color='teal' sub content='Step 3 - Preview & Upload' />
      {files.length > 0 && (
        <>
          <div
            className='img-preview'
            style={{ minHeight: 200, minWidth: 200, overflow: 'hidden' }}
          />
          <Button.Group>
					<Button style={{ width: 100 }} positive icon='check' />
					<Button style={{ width: 100 }} icon='close' />
					</Button.Group>
        </>
      )}
    </Grid.Column>
    ```

### [5. Adding an upload image method: upload to FirebaseStorage, Firebase.auth, and Firestore](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/970d27be4a661e34d4ddb35367e0d4db38011989)
- Now that we have the image upload widget working, we want to upload to FirebaseStorage. We also want to update the photoURL in the Firebase.auth, so that if we do need to use the currentUser anywhere in our app, we have the updated user profile. We also want to update the user's main profile photo if this is the first image they uploaded. We need to create two methods. One is for FirebaseStorage to upload the file and the second is for firestoreService
- In firebaseService.js file:
  - Write an uploadToFirebaseStorage method that uploads a file to FiresbaseStorage
    - This function takes file and filename as arguments
    - First, get the user reference, the currently logged in user, from firebase.auth().currentUser and assign it to a user variable
    - Then get the storage ref from firebase.storage().ref() and assign to a storageRef variable
    - Then return storageRef.child(`${user.uid}/user_images/${filename}`) containing the reference pathname, then .put(filename) method to upload data/file to the reference location. The .child() method returns a reference to a relative path from this reference
    - The directory created in firebaseStorage is: user.uid -> user_images -> filename
    - What we get back from this function is an UploadTask, firebase.storage.UploadTask. This UploadTask will allow us to get the download URL
    ```javascript
    export function uploadToFirebaseStorage(file, filename) {
      const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
      const storageRef = firebase.storage().ref();
      return storageRef.child(`${user.uid}/user_images/${filename}`).put(file);
    }
    ```
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Write an async updateUserProfilePhoto method to update the user profile photo in Firebase.auth and Firestore
    - This method takes a downloadURL and filename as arguments
    - First, get a reference to the current user from `firebase.auth().currentUser` and assign it to a user variable
    - Then get a reference to this user document from Firestore `db.collection('users').doc(user.uid)`. The reason why we want a ref of this user doc is we want to check to see if there's a photo is already inside there. If there is, we don't want to update the profile. If there isn't, we want to update the main profile photo
    - In this function, we also want to take the opportunity to update the photoURL inside the firebase.auth
    - Use the try/catch block
    - If there's an error, throw the error. We'll deal with the error in the component
    - In the try block:
      - First, call the userDocRef.get() method to get the user document and assign the returned data to userDoc variable. This is equivalent to making an api call and it's an async operation. Add 'await' keyword in front of it
      - Second, write an if statement to check the user document to see if they do not have a photo in there
        - If they don't, then we want to update the user document photoURL property with the downloadURL using the .update() method. This is an async operation, so add 'await' keyword in front of it
        - Then also update the user photoURL property in firebase.auth by calling the .updateProfile() method on user. Rememeber that `const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;`. This is also an async operation, so add the 'await' keyword in front of it
      - Third, we want to add the photo to the photos collection inside the user document in Firestore users collection. This is an async operation, so add the 'await' keyword. We also want to add a return so that we can use this data later
        - So first, we want to access the user document with `db.collection('users').doc(user.uid)`
        - To add a new collection inside the user document, add the `.collection('photos')` method after it and pass in the name of the collection. If there's a photos collection for this user already, it simply adds the photo to this existing collection
        - Then to add a document inside this new 'photos' collection, add the `.add()` method after it and specify the properties inside this document
    ```javascript
    export async function updateUserProfilePhoto(downloadURL, filename) {
      const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
      const userDocRef = db.collection('users').doc(user.uid);
      try {
        const userDoc = await userDocRef.get();
        if (!userDoc.data().photoURL) {
          await db.collection('user').doc(user.uid).update({
            photoURL: downloadURL
          });
          await user.updateProfile({
            photoURL: downloadURL
          });
        }
        return await db.collection('users').doc(user.uid).collection('photos').add({
          name: filename,
          url: downloadURL
        });
      } catch (error) {
        throw error;
      }
    }
    ```

### [6. Using the upload method in the photo widget](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/094507eab3007714f727d9cc21d276a58b43be31)
- In PhotoUploadWidget.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import cuid from 'cuid';
    import { toast } from 'react-toastify';
    import { getFileExtension } from '../util/util';
    import { uploadToFirebaseStorage } from '../../firestore/firebaseService'
    import { updateUserProfilePhoto } from '../../firestore/firestoreService';
    ```
  - Create a loading state to handle the loading indicator. Use useState() hook and inititalize its value to false
    - `const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);`
  - Write a handleUploadImage function that uploads the photo to FirebaseStorage, updates the photoURL property in Firestore user doc and in user profile firebase.auth, and adds the photo to the Firestore photos collection. It's done by executing the uploadToFirebaseStorage() and updateUserProfilePhoto() methods
    - First thing is call the setLoading() methdod to set the loading indicator to true
    - Second, we want to give each of the image we upload a unique name. To do that we'll make use of the cuid library to give us a unique id and a utility function to give us the file extension
    - Third, create an uploadTask by calling the uploadToFirebaseStorage() method with the image and filename to upload to FirebaseStorage
      - The uploadTask will return a snapshot or we can get a snapshot from the uploadTask
    - Fourth, use uploadTask.on() method to listen to state-changes. This allows us to track the progress of how much of the file is being uploaded in the snapshot
      - 1st arg is set to 'state_changed'
      - 2nd arg is a function that takes snapshot as an argument. This function tracks the file upload progress
      - 3rd arg is a function that takes error as an argument and handles the error with toast.error() method to display the error.message
      - 4th arg is a callback function, what to do when this file upload is complete. In this callback:
        - First, we want to get the downloadURL from the snapshot by calling the `uploadTask.snapshot.ref.getDownloadURL()` method. This method will return a promise, so we can use the .then() operator and pass in a callback function to handle the downloadURL that we get back
        - Second, once we have the downloadURL, inside this promise callback function, we call the updateUserProfileProfile() and pass in the downloadURL and filename as arguments. This will update the user photo in Firebase and Firestore. This method is also an async operation and it returns a promise. Use the .then() operator and pass in a callback function to handle success. And use the .catch() operator and pass in a callback function to handle the error
        - If this is completed successfully, inside this promise callback function,
          - Call setLoading() method and set it to false
          - Call the handleCancelCrop() method. This will remove the image from the photo widget and returns to how they were originally
          - Call setEditMode() method and set it to false
        - If there's an error being returned, in the callback function,
          - take the error as an argument
          - call the toast.error() method to display the error.message
          - call setLoading() method and set it to false to turn off the loading indicator
    ```javascript
    function handleUploadImage() {
      setLoading(true);
      const filename = cuid() + '.' + getFileExtension(files[0].name);
      const uploadTask = uploadToFirebaseStorage(image, filename);
      uploadTask.on(
        'state_changed',
        (snapshot) => {
          const progress =
            (snapshot.bytesTransferred / snapshot.totalBytes) * 100;
          console.log('Upload is ' + progress + '% done');
        },
        (error) => {
          toast.error(error.message);
        },
        () => {
          uploadTask.snapshot.ref.getDownloadURL().then((downloadURL) => {
            updateUserProfilePhoto(downloadURL, filename)
              .then(() => {
                setLoading(false);
                handleCancelCrop();
                setEditMode(false);
              })
              .catch((error) => {
                toast.error(error.message);
                setLoading(false);
              });
          });
        }
      );
    }
    ```
  - Write a handleCancelCrop function that resets the files and image states to empty
    ```javascript
    function handleCancelCrop() {
      setFiles([]);
      setImage(null);
    }
    ```
- In src/app/common/util/util.js file:
  - Write a getFileExtension util function to get a file extension
    ```javascript
    export function getFileExtension(filename) {
      return filename.slice((filename.lastIndexOf('.') -1 >>> 0) + 2);
    }
    ```
- In PhotosTab.jsx file:
  - Pass down the setEditMode method as props to the PhotoUploadWidget child component
    - `<PhotoUploadWidget setEditMode={setEditMode} />`
- In PhotoUploadWidget.jsx file:
  - Receive the setEditMode props from the PhotosTab parent component
  - In JSX:
    - In the 'check' Button element:
      - Call the handleUploadImage method to handle the onClick event
      - Set the loading property to loading state
      ```javascript
      <Button
        onClick={handleUploadImage}
        loading={loading}
        style={{ width: 100 }}
        positive
        icon='check'
      />
      ```
    - In the 'close' Button element:
      - Call the handleCancelCrop method to handle the onClick event
      - Set the disabled property to loading state
      ```javascript
      <Button
        onClick={handleCancelCrop}
        disabled={loading}
        style={{ width: 100 }}
        icon='close'
      />
      ```
- Go to Firesbase console website: https://console.firebase.google.com/
  - Select Storage from the main menu
  - Click on the 'Get Started' button and accept the default bucket rules
  - This will create a storage for our application

### [7. Displaying the images in PhotosTab](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/f4f8ed37bb74c4ab1ebdc63ef6628688f1531636)
- Now that we're able to upload photos to firebaseStoge, firebase.auth, and Firestore, we want to create a new constant, a new action, and new reducer to store photos in Redux store
- In profileConstants.js file:
  - Create a new constant for LISTEN_TO_USER_PHOTOS
  - `export const LISTEN_TO_USER_PHOTOS = 'LISTEN_TO_USER_PHOTOS';`
- In profileActions.js file:
  - Import the constant: `import { LISTEN_TO_USER_PHOTOS } from "./profileConstants";`
  - Write a listenToUserPhotos action creator function that listens to user photos in Firestore
    - This function takes photos as an argument
    - This function returns as an object,
      - the action type of LISTEN_TO_USER_PHOTOS
      - the payload of photos
    ```javascript
    export function listenToUserPhotos(photos) {
      return {
        type: LISTEN_TO_USER_PHOTOS,
        payload: photos
      };
    }
    ```
- In profileReducer.js file:
  - Import the constant: `import { LISTEN_TO_USER_PHOTOS } from './profileConstants';`
  - In the initialState object, add a photos property and initialize it to an empty array
    ```javascript
    const initialState = {
      currentUserProfile: null,
      selectedUserProfile: null,
      photos: []
    };
    ```
  - In the profileReducer function:
    - Add a new case in the switch statement for LISTEN_TO_USER_PHOTOS action type
      - This action returns as an object, the existing state and the photos property of payload
      - When this action is dispatched, photos property in the profileReducer redux store will contain an array of photos from Firestore photos collection
    ```javascript
    case LISTEN_TO_USER_PHOTOS:
      return {
        ...state,
        photos: payload
      };
    ```
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Write a query getUserPhotos function that gets user photos from Firestore photos collection
    - This function takes userUid as an argument
    - It returns the photos from Firstore photos collection
    ```javascript
    export function getUserPhotos(userUid) {
      return db.collection('users').doc(userUid).collection('photos');
    }
    ```
- In PhotosTab.jsx file:
  - Import the useFirestoreCollection() hook: `import useFirestoreCollection from '../../../app/hooks/useFirestoreCollection';`
  - Import the getUserPhotos method: `import { getUserPhotos } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';`
  - Import the listenToUserPhotos() action: `import { listenToUserPhotos } from '../profileActions';`
  - Create a dispatch method using useDispatch() hook
    - `const dispatch = useDispatch();`
  - Extract the loading property from asyncReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { loading } = useSelector((state) => state.async); `
  - Extract the photos property from profileReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { photos } = useSelector((state) => state.profile);`
  - Use the custom useFirestoreCollection() hook:
    - This custom hook takes query, data, and deps parameters as an object
    - For query param, the arrow function is going to call the query getUserPhotos() method and pass in profile.id as an argument
    - For data param, the arrow function takes photos that we got back from the query as an argument and then dispatches the listenToUserPhotos() action that takes the photos as an argument
    - For deps param, list profile.id and dispatch as two dependencies in the dependencies array. Any changes to these dependencies will cause the component to re-render
    ```javascript
    useFirestoreCollection({
      query: () => getUserPhotos(profile.id),
      data: (photos) => dispatch(listenToUserPhotos(photos)),
      deps: [profile.id, dispatch]
    });
    ```
  - In JSX:
    - The `<Tab.Pane>` component can take loading property and set it to loading state: `<Tab.Pane loading={loading}>`
    - Then we're going to map over the photos array and display each photo in a Card component
      - Since this is an array of photos, the Card component will need to be given a key and set it to photo.id
      - The Image src set to photo.url
      ```javascript
      <Card.Group itemsPerRow={5}>
        {photos.map((photo) => (
          <Card key={photo.id}>
            <Image src={photo.url} />
            <Button.Group fluid width={2}>
              <Button basic color='green' content='Main' />
              <Button basic color='red' icon='trash' />
            </Button.Group>
          </Card>
        ))}
      </Card.Group>
      ```
- Now we should be able to see the user photos collection in the PhotosTab

### [8. Setting the main profile photo](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/a7f565af70ebe9a499b33604398ef83c68369d5a)
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Write an async setMainPhoto function that updates the photoURL property in Firestore user document and updates the user profile photoURL property in firebase.auth
    - This function takes photo as an argument
    - First, get the currently logged in user from firebase.auth and assign it to user variable
    - Use a try/catch block
    - If there's an error, throw the error back to the component
    - In the try block:
      - First, we want to update the photoURL property in Firestore users collection user doc. Call the .update() method on user doc and set the photoURL property to photo.url. This is an async operation, so add the 'await' keyword in front of it
      - Second, we want to update the user profile photoURL property in firebase.auth. Call the .updateProfile() method on user variable and set the photoURL property to photo.url. This is also an async operation, so add the 'await' keyword in front of it. We also want to return from this because we want to turn off the loading indicator after this operation is done
    ```javascript
    export async function setMainPhoto(photo) {
      const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
      try {
        await db.collection('users').doc(user.uid).update({
          photoURL: photo.url
        });
        return await user.updateProfile({
          photoURL: photo.url
        });
      } catch (error) {
        throw error;
      }
    }
    ```
- In PhotosTab.jsx file:
  - Import the setMainPhoto function: `import { setMainPhoto } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';`
  - Create an updating state using useState() hook and initialize its value to false
    - `const [updating, setUpdating] = useState(false);`
  - Write an async handleSetMainPhoto function that executes the setMainPhoto function. This will update the photoURL property with the new photo.url in Firestore user doc and user profile firebase.auth
    - This function takes photo as an argument
    - First, call the setUpdating() method and set it to true
    - Then use the try/catch block
    - If there's an error, call the toast.error() method and display the error.message
    - In the try block:
      - Call the setMainPhoto() method and pass in photo as an argument. This is an async operation, so add the 'await' keyword in front of it
    - Finally, call the setUpdating() method again and set it back to false to turn off the loading indicator
    ```javascript
    async function handleSetMainPhoto(photo) {
      setUpdating(true);
      try {
        await setMainPhoto(photo);
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error(error.message);
      } finally {
        setUpdating(false);
      }
    }
    ```
  - In the 'Main' Button element:
    - To handle the onClick event, call the handleSetMainPhoto() method inside a callback function because we need to pass the photo as an argument to handleSetMainPhoto
    - Also add the loading property and set it to updating state
    ```javascript
    <Button
      loading={updating}
      onClick={() => handleSetMainPhoto(photo)}
      basic
      color='green'
      content='Main'
    />
    ```
- Now when the user clicks on the 'Main' button of a particular photo to set it as their main profile photo, it should update in both the ProfilePage and the currently logged in user profile picture in NavBar
- However, the problem we're running into now is the loading indicator for the 'Main' button is running for all photos, not just the photo we want to set. To fix this problem, we need to make some adjustments to the updating state
- In PhotosTab.jsx file:
  - For the updating state, we want to initialize the state as an object instead of a simple boolean value
    - Initialize the isUpdating property to false
    - Initialize the target property to null
    - `const [updating, setUpdating] = useState({ isUpdating: false, target: null });`
  - Then in handleSetMainPhoto() function:
    - This function takes target as a 2nd arg
    - Call the setUpdating() method to set the isUpdating property to true and set target to target
    - And in finally, call the setUpdating() method to set the isUpdating property back to false and target back to null
    ```javascript
    async function handleSetMainPhoto(photo, target) {
      setUpdating({ isUpdating: true, target });
      try {
        await setMainPhoto(photo);
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error(error.message);
      } finally {
        setUpdating({ isUpdating: false, target: null });
      }
    }
    ```
  - In the 'Main' Button element:
    - Add a name property and set it to photo.id
    - For the loading property, set it to `updating.isUpdatng && updating.target === photo.id`. The loading indicator will only run if isUpdating is true AND the updating target is equal to photo.id, which is the name of the Button element
    - Add a disabled property and set it to `photo.url === profile.photoURL`. This prevents the user from setting this photo as the main photo again if this photo is already the profile photo
    - For onClick event handler,
      - call the handleSetMainPhoto method inside the callback function since we need to pass in parameters to the method
      - the callback takes the e/events as an argument
      - the handleSetMainPhoto method takes photo and e.target.name as arguments
    ```javascript
    <Button
      name={photo.id}
      onClick={(e) => handleSetMainPhoto(photo, e.target.name)}
      loading={
        updating.isUpdating && updating.target === photo.id
      }
      disabled={photo.url === profile.photoURL}
      basic
      color='green'
      content='Main'
    />    
    ```

### [9. Deleting a photo](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/61b9f1c243a2c89b15329948049c3249491bd001)
- When deleting a photo, we want to remove it from firebaseStorage and from Firestore photos collection
- In firebaseService.js file:
  - Write a deleteFromFirebaseStorage function that deletes a photo from firebaseStorage
    - This function takes filename as an argument
    - First, get the current user uid from firebase.auth and assign it to userUid variable
    - Then get a reference to storage from firebase and assign it to storageRef variable
    - Then we need to get a reference to the individual image itself. The .child() method returns a reference to photo based on the given reference pathname. Assign this reference to photoRef variable
    - Lastly, call the .delete() method on photoRef to delete the image from firebaseStorage
    ```javascript
    export function deleteFromFirebaseStorage(filename) {
      const userUid = firebase.auth().currentUser.uid;
      const storageRef = firebase.storage().ref();
      const photoRef = storageRef.child(`${userUid}/user_images/${filename}`);
      return photoRef.delete();
    }
    ```
- In firesoreService.js file:
  - Write a deletePhotoFromCollection function that deletes an image from Firestore photos collection based on the given photoId
    - This function takes photoId as an argument
    - First, get the current user uid from firebase.auth and assign it to userUid variable
    - Call the .delete() method on the photos collection document of the given photoId
    ```javascript
    export function deletePhotoFromCollection(photoId) {
      const userUid = firebase.auth().currentUser.uid;
      return db
        .collection('users')
        .doc(userUid)
        .collection('photos')
        .doc(photoId)
        .delete();
    }
    ```
- In PhotosTab.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import { deleteFromFirebaseStorage } from '../../../app/firestore/firebaseService';
    import { deletePhotoFromCollection } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';
    ```
  - Create a deleting state using useState() hook and set the initial state as an object
    - `const [deleting, setDeleting] = useState({ isDeleting: false, target: null });`
  - Write an async handleDeletePhoto function that deletes a photo from firebaseStorage and from Firestore photos collection. This function executes the deleteFromFirebaseStorage and deletePhotoFromCollection functions to get this done
    - This function takes photo and target as arguments
    - First, call the setUpdating() method to set the isDeleting property to true and set target to target
    - Then use the try/catch block
    - If there's an error, call the toast.error() method and display the error.message
    - In the try block:
      - Call the deleteFromFirebaseStorage() method and pass in photo.name as an argument. This is an async operation, so add the 'await' keyword in front of it
      - Then call the deletePhotoFromCollection() method and pass in photo.id as an argument. This is an async operation, so add the 'await' keyword in front of it
    - Finally, call the setDeleting() method again to set the isDeleting property to back to false and target back to null. This will turn off the loading indicator when delete is done
    ```javascript
    async function handleDeletePhoto(photo, target) {
      setDeleting({ isDeleting: true, target });
      try {
        await deleteFromFirebaseStorage(photo.name);
        await deletePhotoFromCollection(photo.id);
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error(error.message);
      } finally {
        setDeleting({ isDeleting: false, target: null });
      }
    }
    ```
  - In the 'trash' icon Button element:
    - Add a name property and set it to photo.id
    - Add a loading property and set it to `deleting.isDeletng && deleting.target === photo.id`. The loading indicator will only run if isDeleting is true AND the deleting target is equal to photo.id, which is the name of the Button element
    - Add a disabled property and set it to `photo.url === profile.photoURL`. This prevents the user from deleting the photo if this photo is the profile photo. They would need to swap another photo for the profile photo first before deleting this particular photo
    - For onClick event handler, 
      - call the handleDeletePhoto() method inside a callback function since we need to pass in parameters to the method 
      - the callback takes the e/event as an argument
      - The handleDeletePhoto() method takes photo and e.target.name as arguments
    ```javascript
    <Button
      name={photo.id}
      onClick={(e) => handleDeletePhoto(photo, e.target.name)}
      loading={
        deleting.isdeleting && deleting.target === photo.id
      }
      disabled={photo.url === profile.photoURL}
      basic
      color='red'
      icon='trash'
    />
    ```


## FIREBASE RELATIONSHIPS

### [1. Adding attendances to an event](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/6c51ccc5016acbfc0489b0b1531db4fc971af505)
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - In addEventToFirestore() function:
    - What we have going on at the moment when we're creating an event is we're manually adding static data to the fields. Now that we have the information we need to dynamically populate these fields when we create an event, we're going to update this function
    - First, we're going to get a reference to the currently logged in user from firebase.auth and assign it to a user variable
    - Then we're going to modify the properties that we pass to the .add() method
      - hostedBy, set it to user.displayName
      - hostPhotoURL, set it to user.photoURL or null, if the user doesn't have a photo
      - id of attendees, set to user.uid
      - displayName of attendees, set to user.displayName
      - photoURL of attendees, set to user.photoURL or null
      - Add hostUid property and set it to user.uid
      - Add an attendeeIds property and set it to `firebase.firestore.FieldValue.arrayUnion(user.uid)`. This will create an array of user.uids for the attendeeIds property. This list Field we're going to query, so we can find out which events a user with that specific uid is attending. With Firestore arrays, we can query simple string-based arrays. Our user.uids are going to be strings
    ```javascript
    export function addEventToFirestore(event) {
      const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;

      return db.collection('events').add({
        ...event,
        hostUid: user.uid,
        hostedBy: user.displayName,
        hostPhotoURL: user.photoURL || null,
        attendees: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.arrayUnion({
          id: user.uid,
          displayName: user.displayName,
          photoURL: user.photoURL || null
        }),
        attendeeIds: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.arrayUnion(user.uid)
      });
    }
    ```

### [2. Setting up the event detailed header](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/1d1746ed3de67bc6dc2453c348a0a640b900769c)
- We want to configure the EventDetailedHeader so that only certain buttons show depending on the user's status to that event. Are they the host, are they the attendee, or are they not an attendee?
- In EventDetailedPage.jsx file:
  - First, we want to get the currentUser property from authReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { currentUser } = useSelector((state) => state.auth);`
  - Create an isHost variable that returns a boolean if the event host is the current user. 
    - `const isHost = event.hostUid === currentUser.uid;`
    - Now, we need to be careful when accessing properties where we don't know they exist when isHost is called. We can use the optional chaining operator aka `?` to check and see if the event exists first before accessing the .hostUid property. This way, if event doesn't exist, then it'll be undefined and undefined is going to set to false
    - `const isHost = event?.hostUid === currentUser.uid;`
  - Next is we want establish if the user is going to the event. We want to know if the currentUser is in the attendees list
    - `const isGoing = event?.attendees?.some((a) => a.id === currentUser.uid);`
  - Then we want to pass down these two items as props to the EventDetailedHeader child component
    - `<EventDetailedHeader event={event} isGoing={isGoing} isHost={isHost} />`
- In EventDetailedHeader.jsx file:
  - Receive the isHost and isGoing props from the EventDetailedPage parent component and destructure them
  - In JSX, now we can add conditional logic to show or hide buttons
    - If a user is hosting the event, then they see the 'Manage Event' button
      ```javascript
      {isHost && 
        <Button as={Link} to={`/manage/${event.id}`} color='orange' floated='right'>
          Manage Event
        </Button>
      }
      ```
    - If the user is not the host of the event, then they see the 'Join this event' button to join the event. If the user is not the host and is going to the event, then they see the 'Cancel My Place' button to be able to cancel 
      ```javascript
      {!isHost && (
        <>
          {isGoing ? (
            <Button>Cancel My Place</Button>
          ) : (
            <Button color='teal'>JOIN THIS EVENT</Button>
          )}
        </>
      )}
      ```

### [3. Adding the join event handler](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/8ef5ded88fa4f52c9de96a338e2a009c254180ea)
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Write a addUserAttendance function that adds the currentUser to a given event
    - This function takes an event as an argument
    - First, get a reference to the current user from firebase.auth and assign it to a user variable
    - Then use the .update() method on `db.collection('events').doc(event.id)` to add the currentUser to the attendees array property and the attendeeIds array property of a specified event document
    ```javascript
    export function addUserAttendance(event) {
      const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
      return db.collection('events').doc(event.id).update({
        attendees: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.arrayUnion({
          id: user.uid,
          displayName: user.displayName,
          photoURL: user.photoURL || null
        }),
        attendeeIds: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.arrayUnion(user.uid)
      });
    }
    ```
- In EventDetailedHeader.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    import { toast } from 'react-toastify';
    import { addUserAttendance } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';
    ```
  - Create a loading state using useState() hook and initialize its value to false
    - `const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);`
  - Write an async handleUserJoinEvent function that adds a user to an event as an attendee. This function executes the addUserAttendance method which adds the user in Firestore events collection
    - First, call the setLoading() method to set loading to true
    - Use a try/catch block to run the code since this is an async function
    - If there's an error, call the toast.error() method to display the error.message
    - In the try block, call the addUserAttendance() function and pass in the event as an argument. Since this is an async operation, add the 'await' keyword in front of it
    - Finally, call the setLoading() method again to set the loading state back to false
    ```javascript
    async function handleUserJoinEvent() {
      setLoading(true);
      try {
        await addUserAttendance(event);
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error(error.message);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }
    ```
  - In the 'Join the event' Button element:
    - For onClick event handler, call the handleUserJoinEvent method and it doesn't take any arguments
    - Add the loading property and set it to loading state
    ```javascript
    <Button
      onClick={handleUserJoinEvent}
      loading={loading}
      color='teal'
    >
      JOIN THIS EVENT
    </Button>
    ```

### [4. Cancelling a user attenadance](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/772b2357be15b7feea0a510910855e3172535db8)
- When it comes to removing objects from Firestore arrays, it can be a bit of a challenge. We can't use an arrayRemove() method to remove an object from an array. In our case, it's removing a user from an event's attendees list. The attendees array contains the user objects. To get this done, first, we need to get the events collection document and then use a normal array filter method to update the array and remove the currentUser from the array
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Write an async cancelUserAttendance function that gets the event doc to remove the currentUser from the attendees array property and from the attendeeIds array property of a given event. This is an async function since we need to get the events collection doc
    - First, get a reference to the current user from firebase.auth and assign it to a user variable
    - Then use a try/catch block
    - If there's an error, throw the error back to the component
    - In the try block:
      - Use the .get() method to get the event doc from events collection document of a given event.id. Add the 'await' keyword in front of it for we need to wait for this operation to complete. Assign it to an eventDoc variable
      - Then use the .update() method to update the attendeeIds and attendees properties in events collection document of a given event.id
        - For the attendeeIds property, use the .arrayRemove() method to remove the user.uid from the array
        - For the attendees property, first, access the data of the eventDoc that we got back `eventDoc.data()`. Then call the .filter() method on the attendees array to upate the array and remove the attendee.id that matches with the user.uid
    ```javascript
    export async function cancelUserAttendance(event) {
      const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
      try {
        const eventDoc = await db.collection('events').doc(event.id).get();
        return db
          .collection('events')
          .doc(event.id)
          .update({
            attendeeIds: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.arrayRemove(user.uid),
            attendees: eventDoc
              .data()
              .attendees.filter((attendee) => attendee.id !== user.uid)
          });
      } catch (error) {
        throw error;
      }
    }
    ```
- In EventDetailedHeader.jsx file:
  - Import the cancelUserAttendance function: `import { cancelUserAttendance } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';`
  - Write an async handleUserLeaveEvent function that removes a user from an event as an attendee. This function executes the cancelUserAttendance method which removes the user in Firestore events collection document
    - First, call the setLoading() method to set loading to true
    - Use a try/catch block to run the code since this is an async function
    - If there's an error, call the toast.error() method to display the error.message
    - In the try block, call the cancelUserAttendance() function and pass in the event as an argument. Since this is an async operation, add the 'await' keyword in front of it
    - Finally, call the setLoading() method again to set the loading state back to false
    ```javascript
    async function handleUserLeaveEvent() {
      setLoading(true);
      try {
        await cancelUserAttendance(event);
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error(error.message);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }
    ```
  - In the 'Cancel My Place' Button element:
    - For onClick event handler, call the handleUserLeaveEvent method and it doesn't take any arguments
    - Add the loading property and set it to loading state
    ```javascript
    <Button onClick={handleUserLeaveEvent} loading={loading}>
      Cancel My Place
    </Button>
    ```

### [5. Adding the user nav links](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/b6c038ab89d355de42eb04757473efe85309a4d5)
- In the EventDetailedPage, we want to add a ribbon label to the user what hosts the event. We also want to add nav links for the attendees and hosts throughout the event page. This way, when other users visiting the event page, they can easily go to others profile pages
- In EventDetailedPage.jsx file:
  - Pass down the event.hostUid as hostUid props to the EventDetailedSidebar child component
    - `<EventDetailedSidebar attendees={event?.attendees} hostUid={event.hostUid} />`
- In EventDetailedSidebar.jsx file:
  - Import the Link component: `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Import Semantic Label component: `import { Label } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Receive the hostUid props from the EventDetailedPage parent component and destructure it
  - In JSX:
    - Just above the Item.Image element, write a condition to check if the hostUid is equal to the attendee.id. If it is, render the Semantic UI Label component and set the content to Host
      ```javascript
      {hostUid === attendee.id && (
        <Label
          style={{ position: 'absolute' }}
          color='orange'
          ribbon='right'
          content='Host'
        />
      )}
      ```
    - Now, add a profile link for the attendee. Turn the Item element into a link and specify the pathname
      ```javascript
      <Item
        as={Link}
        to={`/profile/${attendee.id}`}
        key={attendee.id}
        style={{ position: 'relative' }}
      >
      ```
- In EventDetailedHeader.jsx file:
  - Make the name of the host a link
    ```javascript
    <p>
      Hosted by <strong><Link to={`/profile/${event.hostUid}`}>{event.hostedBy}</Link></strong>
    </p>
    ```
- In the EventListAttendee.jsx file:
  - Import the Link component: `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Turn the List.Item element into a link and specify the pathname
    - `<List.Item as={Link} to={`/profile/${attendee.id}`}>`
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - In the Item.Description element, make the name of the host a link and specify the pathname
    ```javascript
    <Item.Description>
      Hosted by <Link to={`/profile/${event.hostUid}`}>{event.hostedBy}</Link>
    </Item.Description>
    ```

### [6. Adding the filter functionality](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/d165815131c1784e724bdea247a85749f7dc8f33)
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Create a predicate state using useState() hook
    - What we're going to use to initialize the state is a Javascript map. This is a Javascript object that allows us to use certain methods and we can get and set different elements in this map easily. This is a sufficient way for users to set a particular filter
    - To create a map, call `new Map()`. And inside this map is going to be an array and inside this array are going to be keys and values. So each element inside the map is going to have a key and a value and we can set these different keys and values
    ```javascript
    const [predicate, setPredicate] = useState(
      new Map([
        ['startDate', new Date()],
        ['filter', 'all']
      ])
    );
    ```
  - Write a handleSetPredicate function to set the predicate
    - This function takes a key and value as arguments
    - Call the setPredicate() method to set the predicate. In order for our component to re-render when we update this state, we need to specify a new map inside this method. Inside the new Map(), call the .set() method on the predicate state and pass in the key and value as arguments. The .set() method comes with the map object. This will set the predicate state with the specified key and value element
    ```javascript
    function handleSetPredicate(key, value) {
      setPredicate(new Map(predicate.set(key, value)));
    }
    ```
  - Then pass down the predicate state and the handleSetPredicate function as props to the EventFilters child component
    ```javascript
    <EventFilters
      predicate={predicate}
      setPredicate={handleSetPredicate}
      loading={loading}
    />
    ```
- In EventFilters.jsx file:
  - Destructure the predicate, setPredicate, and loading props received from the EventDashboard parent component
  - In JSX:
    - Inside each of the Menu.Item element:
      - Add a loading property and set it to loading state. We want to disable the filter button while the app is fetching and loading the data
      - Add an active property and set it to predicate state. Since the predicate is a map object, we can call the .get() method on predicate and pass in a key to it
      - For the onClick event handler, call the setPredicate() method inside a callback function and pass in the key and value as arguments
    - Inside the Caledar component:
      - For the onChange event handler, the callback function takes the date value as an argument. Then call the setPredicate() method in the callback and pass in startDate as the key and the date value as the value
      - Add a value property and set it to the predicate state. We can use the .get() method on predicate and pass in 'startDate' or `new Date()` as the key. The `new Date()` is today's date
      - Add a tileDisabled property and this takes a callback. Set loading in the callback
    ```javascript
    export default function EventFilters({ predicate, setPredicate, loading }) {
      return (
        <>
          <Menu vertical size='large' style={{ width: '100%' }}>
            <Header icon='filter' attached color='teal' content='Filters' />
            <Menu.Item
              content='All Events'
              active={predicate.get('filter') === 'all'}
              onClick={() => setPredicate('filter', 'all')}
              disabled={loading}
            />
            <Menu.Item
              content="I'm going"
              active={predicate.get('filter') === 'isGoing'}
              onClick={() => setPredicate('filter', 'isGoing')}
              disabled={loading}
            />
            <Menu.Item
              content="I'm hosting"
              active={predicate.get('filter') === 'isHost'}
              onClick={() => setPredicate('filter', 'isHost')}
              disabled={loading}
            />
          </Menu>
          <Header icon='calendar' attached color='teal' content='Select date' />
          <Calendar
            onChange={(date) => setPredicate('startDate', date)}
            value={predicate.get('startDate' || new Date())}
            tileDisabled={() => loading}
          />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

### [7. Getting the filtered data](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/b0032fddb996fe71391c9c9855ae7906bcbaaf31)
- Now we're going to hook up the filter functionality to listen to events from Firestore method in our firestoreService. So we can go out and listen to the new data we're going to get returned from Firestore
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Let's modify the listenToEventsFromFirestore() function that we wrote earlier:
    - This function accepts the predicate as a parameter
    - First, get a reference to the currently logged in user from firebase.auth and assign it to a user variable
    - Add an eventsRef variable and set it equal to `db.collection('events').orderBy('date')`. This will get the events collection in the order by date
    - Then use a switch statement to handle different filters
      - The switch we're looking for is the 'filter' keyword. Call the predicate.get() method and pass in the word 'filter' to get it
      - Then we specify our cases
      - The 1st case is isGoing:
        - Return the eventsRef and in here, we can specify our queries using the `.where()`
        - The way Firestore queries work is: specify the `.where()` clause and then in it, we can specify the Fields that we want to query on. `.where('Field_name', 'query_type', 'what_we_are_looking_for_in_the_Field')` We can specify as many queries as we want by using the `.where()` clauses
      - 2nd case is isHost:
        - Return the eventsRef with the specified queries
      - The default case:
        - Return the eventsRef with the date greater or equal to the startDate
    ```javascript
    export function listenToEventsFromFirestore(predicate) {
      const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
      const eventsRef = db.collection('events').orderBy('date');

      switch (predicate.get('filter')) {
        case 'isGoing':
          return eventsRef
            .where('attendeeIds', 'array-contains', user.uid)
            .where('date', '>=', predicate.get('startDate'));
        case 'isHost':
          return eventsRef
            .where('hostUid', '==', user.uid)
            .where('date', '>=', predicate.get('startDate'));
        default:
          return eventsRef.where('date', '>=', predicate.get('startDate'));
      }
    }
    ```
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Inside the useFirestoreCollection() hook:
    - Pass in the predicate to the listenToEventsFromFirestore() method as an argument
    - Also list the predicate state as dependency to the custom hook
    ```javascript
    useFirestoreCollection({
      query: () => listenToEventsFromFirestore(predicate),
      data: (events) => dispatch(listenToEvents(events)),
      deps: [dispatch, predicate]
    });
    ```
- At this point, the events filter functionality is not filtering as we expect it. And we would not be able to see the error that's causing this problem from the Redux devTools. We need to console log the error manually from the asyncActionError() action function in the asyncReducer.js file to see what's causing the problem
  ```javascript
  export function asyncActionError(error) {
    console.log(error)
    return {
      type: ASYNC_ACTION_ERROR,
      payload: error
    };
  }
  ```
  - The problem showing in the console is: `FirebaseError: The query requires an index` and a link to the Firebase console is listed to fix this particular problem
  - The problem we're running into is when we're filtering more than one Fields in Firestore, we need to create a composite index in Firestore. Everytime we'er querying multiple Fields we will run into this issue. Firestore will generate the index for us, but we need to go to the website to create the index

### [8. Adding the user event filters: EventsTab component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/6c75a15e7ecb22632e1af1e8ab5b74f64aa966e9)
- In src/features/profiles/profilePage folder, create a component/file called EventsTab.jsx
- In EventsTab.jsx file:
  - Use the code from the AboutTab component as a starter, because the page layout is going to be similar
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    import { Card, Grid, Header, Image, Tab } from 'semantic-ui-react';
    import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
    ```
  - Write an EventsTab functional component that displays the user's events in the events tab
    - We're going to have multiple tabs inside this EventsTab so the user can click on the tab to show that type of events
    - Create an activeTab state using useState() hook and initialize its value to 0
      - `const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(0);`
    - Create a panes array that has 3 menuItems in it
      ```javascript
      const panes = [
        { menuItem: 'Future Events', pane: { key: 'future' } },
        { menuItem: 'Past Events', pane: { key: 'past' } },
        { menuItem: 'Hosting', pane: { key: 'hosting' } }
      ];
      ```
    - In JSX:
      - Use Semantic UI Tab component to create the inner tabs
        - Call the setActiveTab() method for onTabChange event handler
        - Set panes property to the panes array
        - Specify the menu property
      - The list of events will be displayed underneath each tab in a Card component that the user can click on, and it will take them to the EventDetailedPage
    ```javascript
    export default function EventsTab() {
      const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(0);
      const panes = [
        { menuItem: 'Future Events', pane: { key: 'future' } },
        { menuItem: 'Past Events', pane: { key: 'past' } },
        { menuItem: 'Hosting', pane: { key: 'hosting' } }
      ];

      return (
        <Tab.Pane>
          <Grid>
            <Grid.Column width={16}>
              <Header floated='left' icon='calendar' content='Events' />
            </Grid.Column>
            <Grid.Column width={16}>
              <Tab
                onTabChange={(e, data) => setActiveTab(data.activeIndex)}
                panes={panes}
                menu={{ secondary: true, pointing: true }}
              />
              <Card.Group itemsPerRow={5} style={{ marginTop: 10 }}>
                <Card as={Link} to={`/events`}>
                  <Image
                    src='/assets/categoryImages/drinks.jpg'
                    style={{ minHeight: 100, objectFit: 'cover' }}
                  />
                  <Card.Content>
                    <Card.Header content='Title' textAlign='center' />
                    <Card.Meta textAlign='center'>
                      <div>Date</div>
                      <div>Time</div>
                    </Card.Meta>
                  </Card.Content>
                </Card>
              </Card.Group>
            </Grid.Column>
          </Grid>
        </Tab.Pane>
      );
    }
    ```
- In ProfileContent.jsx file:
  - Import the EventsTab component: `import EventsTab from './EventsTab';`
  - In the 'Events' menuItem, render the EventsTab component
    - `{ menuItem: 'Events', render: () => <EventsTab /> },`

### [9. Adding the user event query](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/0d74bc949ad8eb547596285db8156c04794c1a16)
- In firestoreService.js file:
  - Write an getUserEventsQuery function that gets the user events in Firestore events collection based on the specified query clauses
    - This function takes activeTab and userUid as parameters
    - First, get a referenece to the events collection and assign it to an eventsRef variable
    - Also get a reference to today's date using `new Date()`. Assign it to a today variable
    - Then use a switch statement to handle the filters for different activeTab
      - The switch we're looking for is activeTab that we receive
      - Then we specify our cases
      - The 1st case is for past events:
        - Return the eventsRef with the specified queries and order the events by date in descending order. That means, the latest past event goes on top
      - 2nd case is for events the user hosting:
        - Return the eventsRef with one specified query and order the events by date
      - The default case is for future events:
        - Return the eventsRef with two queries where the attendeeIds contains the userUid and list only events that are greater than today, meaning, future events. Order the events by date
    ```javascript
    export function getUserEventsQuery(activeTab, userUid) {
      let eventsRef = db.collection('events');
      const today = new Date();

      switch (activeTab) {
        case 1: // past events
          return eventsRef
            .where('attendeeIds', 'array-contains', userUid)
            .where('date', '<=', today)
            .orderBy('date', 'desc');
        case 2: // hosting
          return eventsRef.where('hostUid', '==', userUid).orderBy('date');
        default: // future events
          return eventsRef
            .where('attendeeIds', 'array-contains', userUid)
            .where('date', '>=', today)
            .orderBy('date');
      }
    }
    ```

### [10. Adding profile actions for user events](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/4bcaa902b5fdb6c1a9e80817f9372f6f8dff9816)
- In profileConstants.js file:
  - Add another constant for LISTEN_TO_USER_EVENTS. We're creating this action in profile actions because this action is part of the profile page, even though we're listening for events
    - `export const LISTEN_TO_USER_EVENTS = 'LISTEN_TO_USER_EVENTS';`
- In profileActions.js file:
  - Import the constant: `import { LISTEN_TO_USER_EVENTS } from './profileConstants';`
  - Write a listenToUserEvents action function that listens to user events in Firestore
    - This function takes events as a parameter
    - This function returns as an object,
      - the action type of LISTEN_TO_USER_EVENTS
      - the payload of events
    ```javascript
    export function listenToUserEvents(events) {
      return {
        type: LISTEN_TO_USER_EVENTS,
        payload: events
      };
    }
    ```
- In profileReducer.js file:
  - Import the constant: `import { LISTEN_TO_USER_EVENTS } from './profileConstants';`
  - In the initialState object, add a profileEvents property and initialize it to an empty array
    ```javascript
    const initialState = {
      currentUserProfile: null,
      selectedUserProfile: null,
      photos: [],
      profileEvents: []
    };
    ```
  - In the profileReducer function:
    - Add a new case in the switch statement for LISTEN_TO_USER_EVENTS action type
      - This action returns as an object, the existing state and the profileEvents property of payload
      - When this action is dispatched, profileEvents property in profileReducer redux store will contain an array of filtered events from Firestore events collection
    ```javascript
		case LISTEN_TO_USER_EVENTS:
			return {
				...state,
				profileEvents: payload
			};
    ```
- In the ProfileContent.jsx file:
  - Pass down the profile as props to the EventsTab child component
    - `{ menuItem: 'Events', render: () => <EventsTab profile={profile} /> },`
- In EventsTab.jsx file:
  - Destructure the profile props received from the ProfileContent parent component
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
    import useFirestoreCollection from '../../../app/hooks/useFirestoreCollection';
    import { getUserEventsQuery } from '../../../app/firestore/firestoreService';
    import { listenToUserEvents } from '../profileActions';
    import { format } from 'date-fns';
    ```
  - Extract the profileEvents property from profileReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { profileEvents } = useSelector((state) => state.profile);`
  - Extract the loading property from asyncReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { loading } = useSelector((state) => state.async);`
  - Create a dispatch method using useDispatch() hook
    - `const dispatch = useDispatch();`
  - Use the custom useFirestoreCollection() hook:
    - This custom hook takes query, data, and deps parameters as an object
    - For query param, the arrow function is going to call the query getUserEventsQuery() method and pass in activeTab and profile.id as arguments
    - For data param, the arrow function takes events that we got back from the query as an argument and then dispatches the listenToUserEvents() action that takes the events as an argument
    - For deps param, list dispatch, activeTab, and profile.id as three dependencies in the dependencies array. Any changes to these dependencies will cause the component to re-render
    ```javascript
    useFirestoreCollection({
      query: () => getUserEventsQuery(activeTab, profile.id),
      data: (events) => (listenToUserEvents(events)),
      deps: [dispatch, activeTab, profile.id]
    });
    ```
  - In JSX:
    - In the Tab.Pane element, add a loading property and set it to loading state
      - `<Tab.Pane loading={loading}>`
    - Now we can map over the profileEvents array and display each event in a Semantic UI Card component. Map the profileEvents array inside the Card.Group element
      - The Card component will need a key property and set it to event.id. Also set the Link pathname to go to the EventDetailedPage
      - Set the category Image src to event.category
      - In the Card.Header element, set the content to event.title
      - To format the event date and time, use format() method from date-fns to display the date and time the way we want
    ```javascript
    <Card.Group itemsPerRow={5} style={{ marginTop: 10 }}>
      {profileEvents.map((event) => (
        <Card key={event.id} as={Link} to={`/events/${event.id}`}>
          <Image
            src={`/assets/categoryImages/${event.category}.jpg`}
            style={{ minHeight: 100, objectFit: 'cover' }}
          />
          <Card.Content>
            <Card.Header content={event.title} textAlign='center' />
            <Card.Meta textAlign='center'>
              <div>{format(event.date, 'dd MMM yyyy')}</div>
              <div>{format(event.date, 'hh:mm a')}</div>
            </Card.Meta>
          </Card.Content>
        </Card>
      ))}
    </Card.Group>
    ```
    

## ADDING CHAT WITH FIREBASE
- We will use Firebase to store the database of the chat functionality of our application
- FIREBASE
  - Stores data in a JSON Tree
  - Key/value pairs
  - Auto generated ID is actually a timestamp
  - Firebase original purpose was for chat apps
  - Realtime
- Realtime Database vs. Cloud Firestore
  - Realtime Database: Store and sync data in realtime across all connected clients
  - Cloud Firestore: Realtime updates, powerful queries, and automatic scaling

### [1. Setting up Firebase Realtime Database](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/6be1ad67daa5491b97603535eadeb7a01e93c711)
- Go to Firebase dashboard: https://console.firebase.google.com/
- Select Realtime Database from the main menu
- Click on the Rules tab at the top and edit the rules
  - This will allow the authenticated user to read and write the chat comments
  ```javacript
  {
    "rules": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      ".write": "auth != null"
    }
  }
  ```
- In firebaseService.js file:
  - Write an addEventChatComment function that adds a currentUser's comment to the firebase database
    - This function takes eventId and comment as parameters
    - First, get a reference to the currently logged in user from firebase.auth and assign it to a user variable
    - Create a newComment object that has the displayName, photoURL, uid, text, and date properties
    - Then use the .push() method to add the newComment object to Firebase Realtime Database
    - Use `firebase.database()` to access the firebase database rather than the Firestore database
    - Use the `.ref(relative_pathname)` and specify the pathname to get a reference of the location where a piece of data is stored or going to store in firebase database
    - Use the .push() method to add data to a location in firebase database
    ```javascript
    export function addEventChatComment(eventId, comment) {
      const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
      const newComment = {
        displayName: user.displayName,
        photoURL: user.photoURL,
        uid: user.uid,
        text: comment,
        date: Date.now()
      };
      return firebase.database().ref(`chat/${eventId}`).push(newComment);
    }
    ```

### [2. Setting up the chat form: EventDetailedChatForm component](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/4e080bc310a04ce3c1e1c649a80ebd92fa04795f)
- In EventDetailedPage.jsx file:
  - Pass down the eventId as props to the EventDetailedChat child component
    - `<EventDetailedChat eventId={event.id} />`
- In EventDetailedChat.jsx file:
  - Destructure the eventId props received from the EventDetailedPage parent component
  - Import the EventDetailedChatForm component: `import EventDetailedChatForm from './EventDetailedChatForm';`
  - In JSX and at the very bottom of Comment.Group element, instantiate the EventDetailedChatForm component
    - Pass down the eventId props to the EventDetailedChatForm child component
    - `<EventDetailedChatForm eventId={eventId} />`
- In src/features/events/eventDetailed folder, create a component/file called EventDetailedChatForm.jsx
- In EventDetailedChatForm.jsx file:
  - Import the following
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { Form, Formik } from 'formik';
    import { toast } from 'react-toastify';
    import { addEventChatComment } from '../../../app/firestore/firebaseService';
    import MyTextArea from '../../../app/common/form/MyTextArea';
    import { Button } from 'semantic-ui-react';
    ```
  - Write an EventDetailedChatForm functional component that displays the chat form
    - This component receives the eventId props from the EventDetailedChat parent component
    - Use the Formik component to create the chat form
      - Specify the initialValues and onSubmit properties for Formik component
    - Then inside the Formik component:
      - Use render props to destructure the isSubmitting props from Formik
      - Then inside the render props function, render the Formik Form component
      - Inside the Form component, instantiate the MyTextArea component and add a 'Add reply' Button after that
    ```javascript
    export default function EventDetailedChatForm({ eventId }) {
      return (
        <Formik
          initialValues={{ comment: '' }}
          onSubmit={async (values, { setSubmitting, resetForm }) => {
            try {
              await addEventChatComment(eventId, values.comment);
              resetForm();
            } catch (error) {
              toast.error(error.message);
            } finally {
              setSubmitting(false);
            }
          }}
        >
          {({ isSubmitting }) => (
            <Form className='ui form'>
              <MyTextArea
                name='comment'
                placeholder='Please enter your comment here'
                rows={2}
              />
              <Button
                loading={isSubmitting}
                content='Add reply'
                icon='edit'
                primary
                type='submit'
              />
            </Form>
          )}
        </Formik>
      );
    }
    ```
- Now when a currentUser adds a comment in the chat form, the comment is added in firebase database under: chat -> eventId -> comment ID along with the comment detailed info

### [3. Listening to the chat data](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/9565df803a5a6f02b3cf5c176a90026526abc81c)
- Now that we have some comments in firebase database to listen to, we're going to add them to Redux store and use that to display on the page
- In eventConstants.js file:
  - Create another constant for LISTEN_TO_EVENT_CHAT
  - `export const LISTEN_TO_EVENT_CHAT = 'LISTEN_TO_EVENT_CHAT';`
- In eventActions.js file:
  - Import the constant: `import { LISTEN_TO_EVENT_CHAT } from './eventConstants';`
  - Write a listenToEventChat action creator function that listens to an event chat in firebase database
    - This function takes a comments as a parameter
    - This function returns as an object,
      - the action type of LISTEN_TO_EVENT_CHAT
      - the payload of comments
    ```javascript
    export function listenToEventChat(comments) {
      return {
        type: LISTEN_TO_EVENT_CHAT,
        payload: comments
      };
    }
    ```
- In eventReducer.js file:
  - Import the constant: `import { LISTEN_TO_EVENT_CHAT } from './eventConstants';`
  - In the initialState object, add a comments property and initialized to an empty array
    ```javascript
    const initialState = {
      events: [],
      comments: []
    };
    ```
  - In the profileReducer function:
    - Add another case in the switch statement for LISTEN_TO_EVENT_CHAT action type
      - This action returns as an object, the existing state and the comments state property of payload
      - When this action is dispatched, comments property in the eventReducer redux store will contain an array of comments from firebase database of an event chat
    ```javascript
		case LISTEN_TO_EVENT_CHAT:
			return {
				...state,
				comments: payload
			};
    ```
- In firebaseService.js file:
  - Write a getEventChatRef function that gets an event chat reference from firebase database
    - This function takes an eventId as a parameter
    - Then return the event chat reference in .orderByKey()
      - First get access to the firebase database using `firebase.database()`
      - Then get a reference on firebase database using `.ref()` and specify the pathname. In our case, we want to get to chat directory and then a specific event by its id
      - Then use .orderByKey() method to be explicit that the comments being returned will be in timestamp order
    ```javascript
    export function getEventChatRef(eventId) {
      return firebase.database().ref(`chat/${eventId}`).orderByKey();
    }
    ```
- In EventDetailedChat.jsx file:
  - Import the following:
    ```javascript
    import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
    import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
    import { getEventChatRef } from '../../../app/firestore/firebaseService';
    import EventDetailedChatForm from './EventDetailedChatForm';
    ```
  - Create a dispatch method using useDispatch() hook
    - `const dispatch = useDispatch();`
  - Extract the comments property from eventReducer using useSelector() hook
    - `const { comments } = useSelector((state) => state.event);`
  - Use useEffect() hook
    - This hook takes a function as 1st arg and a dependency array as 2nd arg
    - List the eventId and dispatch as two dependencies in the dependency array
    - Inside the function, call the getEventChatRef() method and pass in the eventId as an argument
    - Next thing is, in order to listen to the data from firebase database, we use the .on() method. The .on() function listens for data change at a particular location
      - Call the .on() method on getEventChatRef()
    - Inside the .on() method:
      - The 1st arg is what we want to listen to. In our case, we want to listen to value
      - The 2nd arg is a callback function. The .on() method returns a snapshot. And the callback is what do we want to do once we have the snapshot. Inside the callback:
        - First, check to see if the snapshot exists. If it doesn't, return early
        - If it does exist, console log the snapshot to see what we're getting back
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      getEventChatRef(eventId).on('value', (snapshot) => {
        if (!snapshot.exists()) return;
        console.log(snapshot.val());
      });
    }, [eventId, dispatch]);
    ```
- In the console, what we currently get back in snapshot is a list of comments in an object. We want the list of comments in an array. Another thing is the key inside this object is the comment id. We want to have this comment id populated inside the data so we can use it in our application. So we need to write a helper method to shape the data that we got back first before we can use it
- In firebaseService.js file:
  - Write a firebaseObjectToArray helper function that shapes the snapshot data into an array that we can use
    - This function takes snapshot as a parameter
    - First, check to see if there's a snapshot. If there is, run the following code
    - To convert the snapshot object into an array, use Object.entries() method and pass in the snapshort as an argument. This will return an array
      - For example, if we have 2 comment objects inside the snapshot object, the Object.entries() methods will return an array that has 2 array items in it. The 1st array item is the first comment and the 2nd array item is the second comment. In each array item, the 1st index is the comment id key in string and the 2nd index is the comment data in object. The 2nd array item is the same structure but for the second comment
      - `[[comment1], [comment2]] -> [["comment1_key", {comment1_value_dataObject}], ["comment2_key", {comment2_value_dataObject}]]`
    - Then to convert each array item into an object, we first use .map() method on the array to get each array item and then use the Object.assign() method to create a new object
      - What we specify first is the target object and we can let it as an empty object
      - The second thing we specify is the properties of the object itself. And we know that data object is the array element at index of 1
      - And then we want to populate the comment id (at index of 0) in the new object as well. So the third thing we specify is a new id property and set it to the array element at index of 0
    ```javascript
    export function firebaseObjectToArray(snapshot) {
      if (snapshot) {
        return Object.entries(snapshot).map((e) =>
          Object.assign({}, e[1], { id: e[0] })
        );
      }
    }
    ```
- In EventDetailedChat.jsx file:
  - Import the firebaseObjectToArray function: `import { firebaseObjectToArray } from '../../../app/firestore/firebaseService';`
  - Import the listenToEventChat() action: `import { listenToEventChat } from '../eventActions';`
  - Call the firebaseObjectToArray() function and pass in snapshot.val(). Console log it to see what we get. What we get back is an array of comment objects. The comment object contains all of the properties about the comment, including the id property
    - `console.log(firebaseObjectToArray(snapshot.val()));`
  - Now that we have the chat comments in the form that we can use, the next thing is dispatch the listenToEventChat() action and pass in the new version of snapshot
  - We can check in Redux store and see the comments data is populated in the commments array property in the eventReducer
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      getEventChatRef(eventId).on('value', (snapshot) => {
        if (!snapshot.exists()) return;
        // console.log(firebaseObjectToArray(snapshot.val()));
        dispatch(listenToEventChat(firebaseObjectToArray(snapshot.val())));
      });
    }, [eventId, dispatch]);
    ```

### [4. Displaying the chat comments](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/74ccf69b1a65288aff15ac9f1809b99910828b1d)
- In EventDetailedChat.jsx file:
  - Import the Link component: `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Import formatDistance: `import { formatDistance } from 'date-fns';`
  - In JSX:
    - We can map over the comments array and display each comment in a Semantic UI Comment component. Map the comments array inside the Comment.Group element
      - The Comment component will need a key property and set it to comment.id
      - For the Comment.Avatar element, set the src to comment.photoURL or the static user image
      - Make the Comment.Author element into a Link and set the link path to comment.uid, which is this user's profile page and set the author's display name to comment.displayName
      - To format the time, use formatDistance() method from date-fns. The 1st arg we specify is comment.date and 2nd arg is today's date `new Date()`. This will display the time since this comment was created from today's time
      - Set Comment.Text element to comment.text
    ```javascript
    <Comment.Group>
      {comments.map((comment) => (
        <Comment key={comment.id}>
          <Comment.Avatar src={comment.photoURL || '/assets/user.png'} />
          <Comment.Content>
            <Comment.Author as={Link} to={`/profile/${comment.uid}`}>
              {comment.displayName}
            </Comment.Author>
            <Comment.Metadata>
              <div>{formatDistance(comment.date, new Date())}</div>
            </Comment.Metadata>
            <Comment.Text>{comment.text}</Comment.Text>
            <Comment.Actions>
              <Comment.Action>Reply</Comment.Action>
            </Comment.Actions>
          </Comment.Content>
        </Comment>
      ))}
    </Comment.Group>
    ```

### [5. Improving the chat UI](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/19161a374a01aac69a1a8dba4dbc3aba45b2933a)
- In EventDetailedChat.jsx file:
  - Right now the chat displays the last comment at the bottom. We have no way to change the order in firebase db, but we can reverse the order on the client side
    - Inside useEffect() hook, use the .reverse() method on firebaseObjectToArray() to reverse the snapshot array
    - `dispatch(listenToEventChat(firebaseObjectToArray(snapshot.val()).reverse()));`
  - Move the EventDetailedChatForm componment to outside and above the Comment.Group element. This way, the chat form is above the chat comments
- We want users to be able to type in their comment and just hit the Enter key to submit the comment. We will remove the 'Add reply' button altogether. With that, we need to change we way we submit the textArea input field
- In EventDetailedChatForm.jsx file:
  - Remove the current MyTextArea component and the Button element
  - Import the Field component: `import { Field, Form, Formik } from 'formik';`
  - Import Loader component: `import { Loader } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Inside the Form wrapper component, we'er going to use the Formik Field component to render the textArea input field
  - Inside the Field component:
    - Use render props to extract the field props. Destructure it in the render props function
    - Then inside the render props function,
      - render a Loader component and set active property to isSubmitting
      - render the textarea element
        - set the rows property to 2
        - write an instruction for the user in placeholder property
        - for onKeyPress event handler, we first want to check how the user presses the keys. If they press the Enter key AND the Shift key, then we're just going to return because we want a normal behavior of someone presses a key, like Enter key. If they press the Enter key AND NOT the Shift key at the same time, then we want to call the handleSubmit() method
  - We also want to pass down the handleSubmit props from Formik as well
    ```javascript
    {({ isSubmitting, handleSubmit }) => (
      <Form className='ui form'>
        <Field name='comment'>
          {({ field }) => (
            <div style={{ position: 'relative' }}>
              <Loader active={isSubmitting} />
              <textarea
                rows='2'
                {...field}
                placeholder='Enter your comment (Enter to submit, SHIFT + Enter for new line)'
                onKeyPress={(e) => {
                  if (e.key === 'Enter' && e.shiftKey) {
                    return;
                  }
                  if (e.key === 'Enter' && !e.shiftKey) {
                    handleSubmit();
                  }
                }}
              ></textarea>
            </div>
          )}
        </Field>
      </Form>
    )}
    ```
- At the moment, even though we're able to add a new line in the textArea input field, however, it does not display the new line in the chat comment after we submitted the comment. To fix this problem, we need to split the comment text in the Comment.Text element in EventDetailedChat.jsx file
- In EventDetailedChat.jsx file:
  - In the Comment.Text element:
    - Use the .split() method on comment.text and pass in \n to split the comment text at \n. `\n` means new line. The .split() method returns an array, containing the splitted values
    - Then use .map() method on the text array and display each text element followed by a break in a span element. This will add a new line after each text element. The span element will need a key and set to the array index
    ```javascript
    <Comment.Text>
      {comment.text.split('\n').map((text, i) => (
        <span key={i}>
          {text}
          <br />
        </span>
      ))}
    </Comment.Text>
    ```
  - Note that in firebase database, the text property of a coment will still have the '\n' included in the text string. What we did in the Comment.Text element is how we want to display the text on the page. The .split() method did not change the original text string

### [6. Clearing the chat comments and chat form validation](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/b1f6ad63b52ca9dbd419b43c8a1aab6ba260113f)
- Right now when we go visit another event page, the current chat comments array that's in the redux store is displaying in every event page. We should not be able to see some other event chat comments when we visit an event page. What we need to do is clear the comments property in eventReducer redux state when the EventDetailedPage dismounts. We need to create an action to clear the store state
- In eventConstants.js file:
  - Create another constant for CLEAR_COMMENTS action
    - `export const CLEAR_COMMENTS = 'CLEAR_COMMENTS';`
- In eventReducer.js file:
  - Import the constant: `import { CLEAR_COMMENTS } from './eventConstants';`
  - In the profileReducer function:
    - Add another case in the switch statement for CLEAR_COMMENTS action type
      - This action returns as an object, the existing state and set the comments property back to an empty array
      - When this action is dispatched, comments property in the eventReducer redux store will reset back to an empty array
    ```javascript
		case CLEAR_COMMENTS:
			return {
				...state,
				comments: []
			};
    ```
- In the EventDetailedChat.jsx file:
  - Import the constant: `import { CLEAR_COMMENTS } from '../eventConstants';`
  - When we're using an useEffect() hook, after a component is unmounted (as in we moved away from this event to somewhere else), then we can use a return function inside the useEffect() to do something else, like cleanup
  - Inside the useEffect() hook:
    - Use a return callback function to dispatch the action type of CLEAR_COMMENTS. This will callout the eventReducer function to clear out the comments array
    - What we can also do is turn off the listener for the event chat in firebase db when a component is unmounted. In the return callback, call the getEventChatRef() method and then call the .off() method on it
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      getEventChatRef(eventId).on('value', (snapshot) => {
        if (!snapshot.exists()) return;
        // console.log(firebaseObjectToArray(snapshot.val()));
        dispatch(listenToEventChat(firebaseObjectToArray(snapshot.val()).reverse()));
      });
      return () => {
        dispatch({ type: CLEAR_COMMENTS });
        getEventChatRef().off();
      };
    }, [eventId, dispatch]);
    ```
- Right now we're not validating the textarea input field for chat form. If the user doesn't have anything in the field they can still submit it
- In EventDetailedChatForm.jsx file:
  - Import Yup: `import * as Yup from 'yup';`
  - Add validationSchema in Formik component and validate the comment property that the text input field is required
    ```javascript
    validationSchema={Yup.object({
      comment: Yup.string().required()
    })}
    ```
  - Then we need to pass down the isValid props in render props to the Form component
    - `{({ isSubmitting, handleSubmit, isValid }) => ( ... )`
  - In the `if (e.key === 'Enter' && !e.shiftKey)` condition:
    - We want to prevent users from submitting when they just press the 'Enter' key alone
    - Add the .preventDefault() method. This will prevent the default behavior
    - Then add `isValid && handleSubmit()`. If the form is not valid, then this prevents the submission from taking place. If the form is valid, then handleSubmit() is called
    ```javascript
    if (e.key === 'Enter' && !e.shiftKey) {
      e.preventDefault()
      isValid && handleSubmit();
    }
    ```

### [7. Adding the reply functionality](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/069145b1d7911383064264e87a0789206cbc45ce)
- Enable a user to reply to a chat comment and we'll only make it one level deep. When the user hits the 'Reply' to a comment, we want to display the EventDetailedChatForm compononent. And after they submitted the reply, we want to close the reply form automatically. Another thing we want to do is add a parentId property to the comment data object. If it's the original comment, then the parentId is set to 0. But if it's a reply comment, then the parentId is set to its parent comment id
- In firebaseService.js file:
  - Lets modify the addEventChatComment function:
    - Instead of accepting comment as a parameter, we accept values that's coming from the form instead
    - Set the value for text property to values.comment
    - Add parentId property and set it to values.parentId
    ```javascript
    export function addEventChatComment(eventId, values) {
      const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
      const newComment = {
        displayName: user.displayName,
        photoURL: user.photoURL,
        uid: user.uid,
        text: values.comment,
        date: Date.now(),
        parentId: values.parentId
      };
      return firebase.database().ref(`chat/${eventId}`).push(newComment);
    }
    ```
- In EventDetailedChat.jsx file:
  - We want to track whether the reply form is open or not. So we'll create a state for this
  - Create a showReplyForm state using useState() hook. This state is an object with open and commentId properties
    ```javascript
    const [showReplyForm, setShowReplyForm] = useState({
      open: false,
      commentId: null
    });
    ```
  - Write a handleCloseReplyForm function to close the reply form
    - This function calls the setShowReplyForm() method to set the open property to false and commentId property back to null
    ```javascript
    function handleCloseReplyForm() {
      setShowReplyForm({ open: false, commentId: null });
    }
    ```
  - In JSX:
    - In the 'Reply' Comment.Action element, add the onClick event handler and call the setShowReplyForm() to change the showReplyForm state when this button is clicked
    - Underneath the Comment.Action element, write a condition to check if showReplyForm.open state is true AND if showReplyForm.commendId in the state is equal to comment.id. If both condition are true, then display the EventDetailedChatForm component as a reply chat form
    - Inside the EventDetailedChatForm component that we use to render the original chat form, we want to pass down 3 props:
      - The eventId props is set to eventId
      - The parentId props is set to value of 0
      - The closeForm props is set to setShowReplyForm function
      - `<EventDetailedChatForm eventId={eventId} parentId={0} closeForm={setShowReplyForm} />`
    - Then inside the EventDetailedChatForm component that we use to render the reply chat form, we want to pass down 3 props:
      - The eventId props is set to eventId
      - The parentId props is set to comment.id
      - The closeForm props is set to handleCloseReplyForm function
    ```javascript
    <Comment.Actions>
      <Comment.Action
        onClick={() =>
          setShowReplyForm({ open: true, commendId: comment.id })
        }
      >
        Reply
      </Comment.Action>
      {showReplyForm.open &&
        showReplyForm.commendId === comment.id && (
          <EventDetailedChatForm
            eventId={eventId}
            parentId={comment.id}
            closeForm={handleCloseReplyForm}
          />
        )}
    </Comment.Actions>
    ```
- In EventDetailedChatForm.jsx file:
  - Destructure the 3 props received from the EventDetailedChat parent component
    - `export default function EventDetailedChatForm({ eventId, parentId, closeForm }) { //code }`
  - In the addEventChatComment() function, instead of sending eventId and values.comment as arguments, we're going to send the eventId and an object. This object contains all the existing values and we also want to append the parentId property
    - `await addEventChatComment(eventId, {...values, parentId});`
  - Once the reply chat form is submitted we want to close the form. Still inside the onSubmit event handler and inside the finally block, call the closeForm() function and set open property to false and commentId property to null
    ```javascript
    onSubmit={async (values, { setSubmitting, resetForm }) => {
      try {
        await addEventChatComment(eventId, {...values, parentId});
        resetForm();
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error(error.message);
      } finally {
        setSubmitting(false);
        closeForm({ open: false, commentId: null });
      }
    }}
    ```

### [8. Displaying the replies](https://github.com/sungnga/react-revents/commit/48adce6a4fa3a89e3f0485c7891b891bf0f80573)
- Right now all of our original comments and reply comments are in one array in firebase database and we have no way to organize the comments in a tree structure. However, we can organize the display of it on the client side. We need to create a utility function to organize our dataset
- In src/app/common/util/util.js file:
  - Write a createDataTree utility function to create a data tree based on a given array/dataset
    - This function takes dataset as a parameter
    - First, create an empty object using Object.create() method and assign it to a hashtable variable
      - `let hashtable = Object.create(null);`
    - Then loop over each element in dataset array using the .forEach() method. For each element, set the hashtable object key to the element id and set the hashtable object value to an object that has all the properties of the array element and also a childNodes property of an empty array
      - `dataset.forEach((a) => (hashtable[a.id] = { ...a, childNodes: [] }));`
    - Create a dataTree variable and set it to an empty array
      - `let dataTree = [];`
    - Then loop over each element in dataset array using the .forEach() method again. For each element, 
      - if parentId property is true (original comment parentId is set to 0. 0 means false), add the hashtable object (which contains this element data) using the .push() method to the childNodes array property of a hashtable object of that parentId. Remember that childNodes is a property of hashtable object. To acess childNodes of a specific hashtable object, use `hashtable[specify_the_hash].childNodes`. And then call a method on childNodes
      - if parentId property is false or doesn't exist (meaning, this is the original comment), add the hashtable object, which contains this element data, to the dataTree array using the .push() method
    - Return the dataTree array
    - The dataTree array contains an array of hastable objects, which are the original comment objects. If there are reply comments to the original comment, they live in the childNodes array property of the original comment object. Each reply comment is also an object and it contains a childNodes array property as well and it has a parentId of its parent comment id
    ```javascript
    export function createDataTree(dataset) {
      let hashtable = Object.create(null);
      dataset.forEach((a) => (hashtable[a.id] = { ...a, childNodes: [] }));
      let dataTree = [];
      dataset.forEach((a) => {
        if (a.parentId) hashtable[a.parentId].childNodes.push(hashtable[a.id]);
        else dataTree.push(hashtable[a.id]);
      });
      return dataTree;
    }
     ```
- In EventDetailedChat.jsx file:
  - Import the utility function: `import { createDataTree } from '../../../app/common/util/util';`
  - In JSX:
    - Before we map over the comments array, we want to pass this comments array to the createDataTree utility function to create a comments data tree. And then map over the comments data tree
      - `{createDataTree(comments).map((comment) => ( //rest of the code )`
    - While mapping over the comments, for each comment element:
      - Inside the Comment wrapper component and at the end of it, write a condition to check if comment.childNodes.length is greater than 0. If it is, that means this comment has a reply comment and we'll render the Comment.Group element inside this condition. If there's no childNode, we won't render this element
      - Inside the Comment.Group element, map over each element of the comment.childNodes array. For each child element, render the Comment component and give it a key of child.id
        ```javascript
        {comment.childNodes.length > 0 && (
          <Comment.Group>
            {comment.childNodes.map((child) => (
              <Comment key={child.id}>
                Paste the code of everything inside the prev Comment component here..
              </Comment>
            ))}
          </Comment.Group>
        )}
        ```
      - Then inside this Comment component, copy and paste the code of everything that is inside the previous Comment component we wrote earlier. Go through this new code and swap the comment element to child element
      - For the childNodes array, we want to display the reverse order of reply comments. Use the .reverse() method on the comment.childNodes array
        - `{comment.childNodes.reverse().map((child) => (...)`
      ```javascript
      {comment.childNodes.length > 0 && (
        <Comment.Group>
          {comment.childNodes.reverse().map((child) => (
            <Comment key={child.id}>
              <Comment.Avatar
                src={child.photoURL || '/assets/user.png'}
              />
              <Comment.Content>
                <Comment.Author as={Link} to={`/profile/${child.uid}`}>
                  {child.displayName}
                </Comment.Author>
                <Comment.Metadata>
                  <div>{formatDistance(child.date, new Date())}</div>
                </Comment.Metadata>
                <Comment.Text>
                  {child.text.split('\n').map((text, i) => (
                    <span key={i}>

## REACT CONCEPTS
- Components
- Virtual DOM
- One way binding
- JSX

**Components**
- Traditional web page: HTML, JS, CSS
- React: components which made up of JS, HTML, CSS

**React uses a Virtual DOM**
- React -> Virtual DOM -> Actual DOM
- Any updates we make are going to be stored inside a virtual representation of Document Object Model, and only those changes are going to be applied to the actual DOM
- This makes React pretty fast

**What is a Virtual DOM**
- Tree of JS Objects that represent the actual DOM itself
- We write the code as if we are recreating the entire DOM on every update and we rely on React to make the changes on our behalf
- Developer returns the DOM they wish to see
- React takes care of the transformation behind the scenes

**One way binding**
- Other libraries use 2 way bindings
  - Model updated in the DOM updates the component
- React bindings only go from component to Virtual DOM which updates the actual DOM
- This makes the code predictable and easy to debug

**Performance**
- The Virtual DOM:
  - Efficient diffing algorithms. React is going to take care of deciding what's necessary to update in the DOM
  - Update subtrees, the different parts of the DOM simultaneously 
  - Batch updates to the DOM
- Result = easy to use and optimized way to build web apps

**JSX**
- When we're writing code of React, what we're effectively doing is just creating Javascript functions that return JSX
- JSX adds an XML Syntax to Javascript, which makes React more elegant
- JSX tags have a tag name, attributes and children. Whilst it looks very similar to HTML, there are a few slight differences
- Note that we're not allowed to use the word 'class' inside JSX because the word 'class' is a reserved word in Javascript. Instead we use className to style our component
